abstract:  away from the topology of the geometry they need to represent. However, at testing time, convexes can also generate explicit representations - polygonal meshes - which can then be used in any downstream application. We introduce a network architecture to represent a low dimensional family of convexes. This family is automatically derived via an auto-encoding process. We investigate the applications of this architecture including automatic convex decomposition, image to 3D reconstruction, and part-based shape retrieval.

title:  Adversarial Latent Autoencoders
authors:  Stanislav Pidhorskyi
abstract:  Autoencoder networks are unsupervised approaches aiming at combining generative and representational properties by learning simultaneously an encoder-generator map. Although studied extensively, the issues of whether they have the same generative power of GANs, or learn disentangled representations, have not been fully addressed. We introduce an autoencoder that tackles these issues jointly, which we call Adversarial Latent Autoencoder (ALAE). It is a general architecture that can leverage recent improvements on GAN training procedures. We designed two autoencoders: one based on a MLP encoder, and another based on a StyleGAN generator, which we call StyleALAE. We verify the disentanglement properties of both architectures. We show that StyleALAE can not only generate 1024x1024 face images with comparable quality of StyleGAN, but at the same resolution can also produce face reconstructions and manipulations based on real images. This makes ALAE the first autoencoder able to compare with, and go beyond the capabilities of a generator-only type of architecture.

title:  GLU-Net: Global-Local Universal Network for Dense Flow and Correspondences
authors:  Prune Truong
abstract:  Establishing dense correspondences between a pair of images is an important and general problem, covering geometric matching, optical flow and semantic correspondences. While these applications share fundamental challenges, such as large displacements, pixel-accuracy, and appearance changes, they are currently addressed with specialized network architectures, designed for only one particular task. This severely limits the generalization capabilities of such networks to new scenarios, where e.g. robustness to larger displacements or higher accuracy is required.

title:  G-TAD: Sub-Graph Localization for Temporal Action Detection
authors:  Mengmeng Xu
abstract:  Temporal action detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in video understanding. Video context is a critical cue to effectively detect actions, but current works mainly focus on temporal context, while neglecting semantic context as well as other important context properties. In this work, we propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) model to adaptively incorporate multi-level semantic context into video features and cast temporal action detection as a sub-graph localization problem. Specifically, we formulate video snippets as graph nodes, snippet-snippet correlations as edges, and actions associated with context as target sub-graphs. With graph convolution as the basic operation, we design a GCN block called GCNeXt, which learns the features of each node by aggregating its context and dynamically updates the edges in the graph. To localize each sub-graph, we also design an SGAlign layer to embed each sub-graph into the Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that G-TAD is capable of finding effective video context without extra supervision and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two detection benchmarks. On ActivityNet-1.3, it obtains an average mAP of 34.09%; on THUMOS14, it reaches 51.6% at IoU@0.5 when combined with a proposal processing method.

title:  TBT: Targeted Neural Network Attack With Bit Trojan
authors:  Adnan Rakin
abstract:  ecurity of modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is under severe scrutiny as the deployment of these models become widespread in many intelligence-based applications. Most recently, DNNs are attacked through Trojan which can effectively infect the model during the training phase and get activated only through specific input patterns (i.e, trigger) during inference. In this work, for the first time, we propose a novel Targeted Bit Trojan(TBT) method, which can insert a targeted neural Trojan into a DNN through the bit-flip attack. Our algorithm efficiently generates a trigger specifically designed to locate certain vulnerable bits of DNN weights stored in main memory (i.e., DRAM). The objective is that once the attacker flips these vulnerable bits, the network still operates with normal inference accuracy with benign input. However, when the attacker activates the trigger by embedding it with any input, the network is forced to classify all inputs to a certain target class. We demonstrate that flipping only several vulnerable bits identified by our method, using available bit-flip techniques (i.e, row-hammer), can transform a fully functional DNN model into a Trojan-infected model. We perform extensive experiments of CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet datasets on both VGG-16 and Resnet-18 architectures. Our proposed TBT could classify 92 % of test images to a target class with as little as 84 bit-flips out of 88 million weight bits on Resnet-18 for CIFAR10 dataset.

title:  PolyTransform: Deep Polygon Transformer for Instance Segmentation
authors:  Justin Liang
abstract:  In this paper, we propose PolyTransform, a novel instance segmentation algorithm that produces precise, geometry-preserving masks by combining the strengths of prevailing segmentation approaches and modern polygon-based methods. In particular, we first exploit a segmentation network to generate instance masks. We then convert the masks into a set of polygons that are then fed to a deforming network that transforms the polygons such that they better fit the object boundaries. Our experiments on the challenging Cityscapes dataset show that our PolyTransform significantly improves the performance of the backbone instance segmentation network and ranks 1st on the Cityscapes test-set leaderboard. We also show impressive gains in the interactive annotation setting.

title:  Multi-Scale Interactive Network for Salient Object Detection
authors:  Youwei Pang
abstract:  Deep-learning based salient object detection methods achieve great progress. However, the variable scale and unknown category of salient objects are great challenges all the time. These are closely related to the utilization of multi-level and multi-scale features. In this paper, we propose the aggregate interaction modules to integrate the features from adjacent levels, in which less noise is introduced because of only using small up-/down-sampling rates. To obtain more efficient multi-scale features from the integrated features, the self-interaction modules are embedded in each decoder unit. Besides, the class imbalance issue caused by the scale variation weakens the effect of the binary cross entropy loss and results in the spatial inconsistency of the predictions. Therefore, we exploit the consistency-enhanced loss to highlight the fore-/back-ground difference and preserve the intra-class consistency. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method without any post-processing performs favorably against 23 state-of-the-art approaches.

title:  Understanding Adversarial Examples From the Mutual Influence of Images and Perturbations
authors:  Chaoning Zhang
abstract:  A wide variety of works have explored the reason for the existence of adversarial examples, but there is no consensus on the explanation. We propose to treat the DNN logits as a vector for feature representation, and exploit them to analyze the mutual influence of two independent inputs based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). We utilize this vector representation to understand adversarial examples by disentangling the clean images and adversarial perturbations, and analyze their influence on each other. Our results suggest a new perspective towards the relationship between images and universal perturbations: Universal perturbations contain dominant features, and images behave like noise to them. This feature perspective leads to a new method for generating targeted universal adversarial perturbations using random source images. We are the first to achieve the challenging task of a targeted universal attack without utilizing original training data. Our approach using a proxy dataset achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art baselines which utilize the original training dataset.

title:  Vision-Language Navigation with Self-Supervised Auxiliary Reasoning Tasks
authors:  Fengda Zhu
abstract:  Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a task where agents learn to navigate following natural language instructions. The key to this task is to perceive both the visual scene and natural language sequentially. Conventional approaches exploit the vision and language features in cross-modal grounding. However, the VLN task remains challenging, since previous works have neglected the rich semantic information contained in the environment (such as implicit navigation graphs or sub-trajectory semantics). In this paper, we introduce Auxiliary Reasoning Navigation (AuxRN), a framework with four self-supervised auxiliary reasoning tasks to take advantage of the additional training signals derived from the semantic information. The auxiliary tasks have four reasoning objectives: explaining the previous actions, estimating the navigation progress, predicting the next orientation, and evaluating the trajectory consistency. As a result, these additional training signals help the agent to acquire knowledge of semantic representations in order to reason about its activity and build a thorough perception of the environment. Our experiments indicate that auxiliary reasoning tasks improve both the performance of the main task and the model generalizability by a large margin. Empirically, we demonstrate that an agent trained with self-supervised auxiliary reasoning tasks substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, being the best existing approach on the standard benchmark.

title:  Set-Constrained Viterbi for Set-Supervised Action Segmentation
authors:  Jun Li
abstract:  This paper is about weakly supervised action segmentation, where the ground truth specifies only a set of actions present in a training video, but not their true temporal ordering. Prior work typically uses a classifier that independently labels video frames for generating the pseudo ground truth, and multiple instance learning for training the classifier. We extend this framework by specifying an HMM, which accounts for co-occurrences of action classes and their temporal lengths, and by explicitly training the HMM on a Viterbi-based loss. Our first contribution is the formulation of a new set-constrained Viterbi algorithm (SCV). Given a video, the SCV generates the MAP action segmentation that satisfies the ground truth. This prediction is used as a framewise pseudo ground truth in our HMM training. Our second contribution in training is a new regularization of feature affinities between training videos that share the same action classes. Evaluation on action segmentation and alignment on the Breakfast, MPII Cooking2, Hollywood Extended datasets demonstrates our significant performance improvement for the two tasks over prior work.

title:  EPOS: Estimating 6D Pose of Objects with Symmetries
authors:  Tomas Hodan
abstract:  We present a new method for estimating the 6D pose of rigid objects with available 3D models from a single RGB input image. The method is applicable to a broad range of objects, including challenging ones with global or partial symmetries. An object is represented by compact surface fragments which allow handling symmetries in a systematic manner. Correspondences between densely sampled pixels and the fragments are predicted using an encoder-decoder network. At each pixel, the network predicts: (i) the probability of each object's presence, (ii) the probability of the fragments given the object's presence, and (iii) the precise 3D location on each fragment. A data-dependent number of corresponding 3D locations is selected per pixel, and poses of possibly multiple object instances are estimated using a robust and efficient variant of the PnP-RANSAC algorithm. In the BOP Challenge 2019, the method outperforms all RGB and most RGB-D and D methods on the T-LESS and LM-O datasets. On the YCB-V dataset, it is superior to all competitors, with a large margin over the second-best RGB method.

title:  Don’t Even Look Once: Synthesizing Features for Zero-Shot Detection
authors:  Pengkai Zhu
abstract:  Zero-shot detection, namely, localizing both seen and unseen objects, increasingly gains importance for large-scale applications, with large number of object classes, since, collecting sufficient annotated data with ground truth bounding boxes is simply not scalable. While vanilla deep neural networks deliver high performance for objects available during training, unseen object detection degrades significantly. At a fundamental level, while vanilla detectors are capable of proposing bounding boxes, which include unseen objects, they are often incapable of assigning high-confidence to unseen objects, due to the inherent precision/recall tradeoffs that requires rejecting background objects. We propose a novel detection algorithm Dont Even Look Once (DELO), that synthesizes visual features for unseen objects and augments existing training algorithms to incorporate unseen object detection. Our proposed scheme is evaluated on Pascal VOC and MSCOCO, and we demonstrate significant improvements in test accuracy over vanilla and other state-of-art zero-shot detectors

title:  Differential Treatment for Stuff and Things: A Simple Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Method for Semantic Segmentation
authors:  Zhonghao Wang
abstract:  We consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation by easing the domain shift between the source domain (synthetic data) and the target domain (real data) in this work. State-of-the-art approaches prove that performing semantic-level alignment is helpful in tackling the domain shift issue. Based on the observation that stuff categories usually share similar appearances across images of different domains while things (i.e. object instances) have much larger differences, we propose to improve the semantic-level alignment with different strategies for stuff regions and for things: 1) for the stuff categories, we generate feature representation for each class and conduct the alignment operation from the target domain to the source domain; 2) for the thing categories, we generate feature representation for each individual instance and encourage the instance in the target domain to align with the most similar one in the source domain. In this way, the individual differences within thing categories will also be considered to alleviate over-alignment. In addition to our proposed method, we further reveal the reason why the current adversarial loss is often unstable in minimizing the distribution discrepancy and show that our method can help ease this issue by minimizing the most similar stuff and instance features between the source and the target domains. We conduct extensive experiments in two unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, i.e. GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, and achieve the new state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.

title:  DA-cGAN: A Framework for Indoor Radio Design Using a Dimension-Aware Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
authors:  Chun-Hao Liu
abstract:  A novel "physics-free" approach of designing indoor radio dot layout for a floor plan is introduced by formulating it as an image-to-image translation problem and solved with customized dimension-aware conditional generative adversarial networks (DA-cGANs). The proposed model generates a desirable radio heatmap and its respective radio dot layout from a given floor plan with wall types, physical dimension, and macro-cell interference, by learning from the accumulated indoor radio designs by human experts. Considering the nature of radio propagation, two new loss functions and a two-stage training strategy are proposed for the generator to learn the right direction of signal propagation and precise dot locations, in addition to a sectional analysis for dealing with large floor plans. Experimental results show that the new model is effectively generating acceptable dot layout designs and that dimension-awareness is a key enabler for this type of prediction.

title:  Affinity Graph Supervision for Visual Recognition
authors:  Chu Wang
abstract:  ing features from such graphs, while the learning of the affinities themselves has been overlooked. Here we propose a principled method to directly supervise the learning of weights in affinity graphs, to exploit meaningful connections between entities in the data source. Applied to a visual attention network, our affinity supervision improves relationship recovery between objects, even without the use of manually annotated relationship labels. We further show that affinity learning between objects boosts scene categorization performance and that the supervision of affinity can also be applied to graphs built from mini-batches, for neural network training. In an image classification task we demonstrate consistent improvement over the baseline, with diverse network architectures and datasets.

title:  VQA With No Questions-Answers Training
authors:  Ben-Zion Vatashsky
abstract:  structure of the question graph to invoke an extendable set of visual estimators. Training is performed for the language part and the visual part on their own, but unlike existing schemes, the method does not require any training using images with associated questions and answers. This approach is able to handle novel domains (extended question types and new object classes, properties and relations) as long as corresponding visual estimators are available. In addition, it can provide explanations to its answers and suggest alternatives when questions are not grounded in the image. We demonstrate that this approach achieves both high performance and domain extensibility without any questions-answers training.

title:  Feudal Steering: Hierarchical Learning for Steering Angle Prediction
authors:  ComputerVisionFoundation Videos
abstract:  ion in driving allows more complex primitives than the steering angle at a single time instance. Composite actions comprise a subroutine or skill that can be re-used throughout the driving sequence. The associated subroutine id is the manager network's goal, so that the manager seeks to succeed at the high level task (e.g. a sharp right turn, a slight right turn, moving straight in traffic, or moving straight unencumbered by traffic). The steering angle at a particular time instance is the worker network output which is regulated by the manager's high level task. We demonstrate state-of-the art steering angle prediction results on the Udacity dataset.

title:  3DV: 3D Dynamic Voxel for Action Recognition in Depth Video
authors:  ComputerVisionFoundation Videos
abstract:  ed as a point set and input into PointNet++ for 3D action recognition, in the end-to-end learning way. The intuition for transferring 3DV into the point set form is that, PointNet++ is lightweight and effective for deep feature learning towards point set. Since 3DV may loose appearance clue, a multi-stream 3D action recognition manner is also proposed to learn motion and appearance feature jointly. To extract richer temporal order information of actions, we also split the depth video into temporal segments and encode this procedure in 3DV integrally. The extensive experiments on the well-established benchmark datasets (e.g., NTU RGB+D 120 and NTU RGB+D 60) demonstrate the superiority of our proposition. Impressively, we acquire the accuracy of 82.4% and 93.5% on NTU RGB+D 120 with the cross-subject and cross-setup test setting respectively. 3DV's code is available at https://github.com/3huo/3DV-Action.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 267: Visual Localization and Mapping with Hybrid SFA
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Visual localization is a crucial requirement in mobile robotics, field and service robotics, and self-driving cars. Recently, unsupervised learning with Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) has shown to produce spatial representations that enable localization from holistic images. The approach is faster and much less complex than state-of-the-art monocular visual SLAM methods while achieving similar localization performance in small-scale environments. However, the holistic approach's performance drops significantly for highly complex, large-scale environments due to scene variations occurring during a training phase. Instead of using holistic images, an alternative is to perform localization relative to unique regions present in a scene. Therefore, in this paper, we add a new component to the SFA localization pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art CNN to identify unique image regions. Hence we propose a hybrid approach that first learns such regions with a pre-trained CNN and then uses SFA for unsupervised pose estimation relative to each region. We present the experimental results from an autonomous robot in two different outdoor environments of varying complexity and size. The experiments show the proposed hybrid approach outperforms holistic SFA w.r.t localization accuracy in both environments, but benefits are more pronounced in the large-scale environment.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 264: Towards Robotic Assembly by Predicting Robust, Precise and Task-oriented Grasps
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Robust task-oriented grasp planning is vital for autonomous robotic precision assembly tasks. Knowledge of the objects' geometry and preconditions of the target task should be incorporated when determining the proper grasp to execute. However, several factors contribute to the challenges of realizing these grasps such as noise when controlling the robot, unknown object properties, and difficulties modeling complex object-object interactions. We propose a method that decomposes this problem and optimizes for grasp robustness, precision, and task performance by learning three cascaded networks. We evaluate our method in simulation on three common assembly tasks: inserting gears onto pegs, aligning brackets into corners, and inserting shapes into slots. Our policies are trained using a curriculum based on large-scale self-supervised grasp simulations with procedurally generated objects. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the first two tasks with a real robot where our method achieves 4.28mm error for bracket insertion and 1.44mm error for gear insertion.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 275: Self-Supervised Object-in-Gripper Segmentation from Robotic Motions
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Accurate object segmentation is a crucial task in the context of robotic manipulation. However, creating sufficient annotated training data for neural networks is particularly time consuming and often requires manual labeling. To this end, we propose a simple, yet robust solution for learning to segment unknown objects grasped by a robot. Specifically, we exploit motion and temporal cues in RGB video sequences. Using optical flow estimation we first learn to predict segmentation masks of our given manipulator. Then, these annotations are used in combination with motion cues to automatically distinguish between background, manipulator and unknown, grasped object. In contrast to existing systems our approach is fully self-supervised and independent of precise camera calibration, 3D models or potentially imperfect depth data. We perform a thorough comparison with alternative baselines and approaches from literature. The object masks and views are shown to be suitable training data for segmentation networks that generalize to novel environments and also allow for watertight 3D reconstruction.

authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Sim-to-real transfer is attractive for robot learning, as it avoids the high cost of collecting data with real robots, but transferring agents from simulation to the real world is challenging. Previous studies have presented promising methods to solve this problem, but they may fail when a wider range of dynamics has to be considered. In this study, we propose a network architecture with explicit and implicit dynamics parameters for sim-to-real transfer from multiple environments. Using this method, we can simultaneously estimate the dynamics of the real world and optimize the action in various kinds of environments. The core novelty lies in the simultaneous dynamics estimation and action optimization, as well as the use of explicit (physically quantifiable) and implicit (latent) dynamics parameters to condition the network input. We apply our method to the object pushing task and verify its effectiveness by comparing it with previous methods and real-world experiments.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 278: MELD: Meta-Reinforcement Learning from Images via Latent State Models
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable autonomous agents, such as robots, to quickly acquire new behaviors by leveraging prior experience in a set of related training tasks. However, the onerous data requirements of meta-training compounded with the challenge of learning from sensory inputs such as images have made meta-RL challenging to apply to real robotic systems. Latent state models, which learn compact state representations from a sequence of observations, can accelerate representation learning from visual inputs. In this paper, we leverage the perspective of meta-learning as task inference to show that latent state models can also perform meta-learning given an appropriately defined observation space. Building on this insight, we develop meta-RL with latent dynamics (MELD), an algorithm for meta-RL from images that performs inference in a latent state model to quickly acquire new skills given observations and rewards. MELD outperforms prior meta-RL methods on several simulated image-based robotic control problems, and enables a real WidowX robotic arm to insert an Ethernet cable into new locations given a sparse task completion signal after only 8 hours of real world meta-training. To our knowledge, MELD is the first meta-RL algorithm trained in a real-world robotic control setting from images.

title:  [CoRL 2020 Best Paper Nominee] Learning from Suboptimal Demonstration via Self-Supervised Reward Regression
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Learning from Demonstration (LfD) seeks to democratize robotics by enabling non-roboticist end-users to teach robots to perform a task by providing a human demonstration. However, modern LfD techniques, e.g. inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), assume users provide at least stochastically optimal demonstrations. This assumption fails to hold in most real-world scenarios. Recent attempts to learn from sub-optimal demonstration leverage pairwise rankings and following the Luce-Shepard rule. However, we show these approaches make incorrect assumptions and thus suffer from brittle, degraded performance. We overcome these limitations in developing a novel approach that bootstraps off suboptimal demonstrations to synthesize optimality-parameterized data to train an idealized reward function. We empirically validate we learn an idealized reward function with ~0.95 correlation with ground-truth reward versus  ~0.75 for prior work. We can then train policies achieving ~200% improvement over the suboptimal demonstration and ~90% improvement over prior work. We present a physical demonstration of teaching a robot a topspin strike in table tennis that achieves 32% faster returns and 40% more topspin than user demonstration.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 285: Learning Trajectories for Visual-Inertial System Calibration via Model-based Heuristic Deep Reinforcement Learning
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Visual-inertial systems rely on precise calibrations of both camera intrinsics and inter-sensor extrinsics, which typically require manually performing complex motions in front of a calibration target. In this work we present a novel approach to obtain favorable trajectories for visual-inertial system calibration, using model-based deep reinforcement learning. Our key contribution is to model the calibration process as a Markov decision process and then use model-based deep reinforcement learning with particle swarm optimization to establish a sequence of calibration trajectories to be performed by a robot arm. Our experiments show that while maintaining similar or shorter path lengths, the trajectories generated by our learned policy result in lower calibration errors compared to random or handcrafted trajectories. The code is publicly available.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 290: Learning Stability Certificates from Data
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Many existing tools in nonlinear control theory for establishing stability or safety of a dynamical system can be distilled to the construction of a certificate function which guarantees a desired property. However, algorithms for synthesizing certificate functions typically require a closed-form analytical expression of the underlying dynamics, which rules out their use on many modern robotic platforms. To circumvent this issue, we develop algorithms for learning certificate functions only from trajectory data. We establish bounds on the generalization error - the probability that a certificate will not certify a new, unseen trajectory - when learning from trajectories, and we convert such generalization error bounds into global stability guarantees. We demonstrate empirically that certificates for complex dynamics can be efficiently learned, and that the learned certificates can be used for downstream tasks such as adaptive control.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 296: Map-Adaptive Goal-Based Trajectory Prediction
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  We present a new method for multi-modal, long-term vehicle trajectory prediction. Our approach relies on using lane centerlines captured in rich maps of the environment to generate a set of proposed goal paths for each vehicle. Using these paths - which are generated at run time and therefore dynamically adapt to the scene - as spatial anchors, we predict a set of goal-based trajectories along with a categorical distribution over the goals. This approach allows us to directly model the goal-directed behavior of traffic actors, which unlocks the potential for more accurate long-term prediction. Our experimental results on both a large-scale internal driving dataset and on the public nuScenes dataset show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for vehicle trajectory prediction over a 6-second horizon. We also empirically demonstrate that our model is better able to generalize to road scenes from a completely new city than existing methods.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 306: The Emergence of Adversarial Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Many real-world problems require the coordination of multiple autonomous agents. Recent work has shown the promise of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn explicit communication strategies that enable complex multi-agent coordination. These works use models of cooperative multi-agent systems whereby agents strive to achieve a shared global goal. When considering agents with self-interested local objectives, the standard design choice is to model these as separate learning systems (albeit sharing the same environment). Such a design choice, however, precludes the existence of a single, differentiable communication channel, and consequently prohibits the learning of inter-agent communication strategies. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a learning model that accommodates individual non-shared rewards and a differentiable communication channel that is common among all agents. We focus on the case where agents have self-interested objectives, and develop a learning algorithm that elicits the emergence of adversarial communications. We perform experiments on multi-agent coverage and path planning problems, and employ a post-hoc interpretability technique to visualize the messages that agents communicate to each other. We show how a single self-interested agent is capable of learning highly manipulative communication strategies that allows it to significantly outperform a cooperative team of agents.

abstract:  The sense of touch is fundamental in several manipulation tasks, but rarely used in robot manipulation. In this work we tackle the problem of learning rich touch features from cross-modal self-supervision. We evaluate them identifying objects and their properties in a few-shot classification setting. Two new datasets are introduced using a simulated anthropomorphic robotic hand equipped with tactile sensors on both synthetic and daily life objects. Several self-supervised learning methods are benchmarked on these datasets, by evaluating few-shot classification on unseen objects and poses. Our experiments indicate that cross-modal self-supervision effectively improves touch representation, and in turn has great potential to enhance robot manipulation skills.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 322: Generalization Guarantees for Imitation Learning
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Control policies from imitation learning can often fail to generalize to novel environments due to imperfect demonstrations or the inability of imitation learning algorithms to accurately infer the expert’s policies. In this paper, we present rigorous generalization guarantees for imitation learning by leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes framework to provide upper bounds on the expected cost of policies in novel environments. We propose a two-stage training method where a latent policy distribution is ﬁrst embedded with multi-modal expert behavior using a conditional variational autoencoder, and then “ﬁne-tuned” in new training environments to explicitly optimize the generalization bound. We demonstrate strong generalization bounds and their tightness relative to empirical performance in simulation for (i) grasping diverse mugs, (ii) planar pushing with visual feedback, and (iii) vision-based indoor navigation, as well as through hardware experiments for the two manipulation tasks.

title:  [CoRL 2020 Best System Paper Nominee] DIRL: Domain-Invariant Representation Learning for Sim-to-Real Transfer
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Generating large-scale synthetic data in simulation is a feasible alternative to collecting/labelling real data for training vision-based deep learning models, albeit the modelling inaccuracies do not generalize to the physical world. In this paper, we present a domain-invariant representation learning (DIRL) algorithm to adapt deep models to the physical environment with a small amount of real data. Existing approaches that only mitigate the covariate shift by aligning the marginal distributions across the domains and assume the conditional distributions to be domain-invariant can lead to ambiguous transfer in real scenarios. We propose to jointly align the marginal (input domains) and the conditional (output labels) distributions to mitigate the covariate and the conditional shift across the domains with adversarial learning, and combine it with a triplet distribution loss to make the conditional distributions disjoint in the shared feature space. Experiments on digit domains yield state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks, while sim-to-real transfer of object recognition for vision-based decluttering with a mobile robot improves from 26.8% to 91.0%, resulting in 86.5% grasping accuracy of a wide variety of objects.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 358: A Long Horizon Planning Framework for Manipulating Rigid Pointcloud Objects
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  We present a framework for solving long-horizon planning problems involving manipulation of rigid objects that operates directly from a point-cloud observation. Our method plans in the space of object subgoals and frees the planner from reasoning about robot-object interaction dynamics. We show that for rigid-bodies, this ion can be realized using low-level manipulation skills that maintain sticking-contact with the object and represent subgoals as 3D transformations. To enable generalization to unseen objects and improve planning performance, we propose a novel way of representing subgoals for rigid-body manipulation and a graph-attention based neural network architecture for processing point-cloud inputs. We experimentally validate these choices using simulated and real-world experiments on the YuMi robot. Results demonstrate that our method can successfully manipulate new objects into target configurations requiring long-term planning. Overall, our framework realizes the best of the worlds of task-and-motion planning (TAMP) and learning-based approaches.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 361: Uncertainty-Aware Constraint Learning for Adaptive Safe Motion Planning from Demonstrations
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  We present a method for learning to satisfy uncertain constraints from demonstrations. Our method uses robust optimization to obtain a belief over the potentially infinite set of possible constraints consistent with the demonstrations, and then uses this belief to plan trajectories that trade off performance with satisfying the possible constraints. We use these trajectories in a closed-loop policy that executes and replans using belief updates, which incorporate data gathered during execution. We derive guarantees on the accuracy of our constraint belief and probabilistic guarantees on plan safety. We present results on a 7-DOF arm and 12D quadrotor, showing our method can learn to satisfy high-dimensional (up to 30D) uncertain constraints and outperforms baselines in safety and efficiency.

title:  One-Shot Imitation from Observing Humans via Domain-Adaptive Meta-Learning
authors:  Tianhe Yu
abstract:  Humans and animals are capable of learning a new behavior by observing others perform the skill just once. We consider the problem of allowing a robot to do the same -- learning from a raw video pixels of a human, even when there is substantial domain shift in the perspective, environment, and embodiment between the robot and the observed human. Prior approaches to this problem have hand-specified how human and robot actions correspond and often relied on explicit human pose detection systems. In this work, we present an approach for one-shot learning from a video of a human by using human and robot demonstration data from a variety of previous tasks to build up prior knowledge through meta-learning. Then, combining this prior knowledge and only a single video demonstration from a human, the robot can perform the task that the human demonstrated. We show experiments on both a PR2 arm and a Sawyer arm, demonstrating that after meta-learning, the robot can learn to place, push, and pick-and-place new objects using just one video of a human performing the manipulation.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 518: Learning Arbitrary-Goal Fabric Folding with One Hour of Real Robot...
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Manipulating deformable objects, such as fabric, is a long standing problem in robotics, with state estimation and control posing a significant challenge for traditional methods. In this paper, we show that it is possible to learn fabric folding skills in only an hour of self-supervised real robot experience, without human supervision or simulation. Our approach relies on fully convolutional networks and the manipulation of visual inputs to exploit learned features, allowing us to create an expressive goal-conditioned pick and place policy that can be trained efficiently with real world robot data only. Folding skills are learned with only a sparse reward function and thus do not require reward function engineering, merely an image of the goal configuration. We demonstrate our method on a set of towel-folding tasks, and show that our approach is able to discover sequential folding strategies, purely from trial-and-error. We achieve state-of-the-art results without the need for demonstrations or simulation, used in prior approaches.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 530: Deep Phase Correlation for End-to-End Heterogeneous Sensor Measurements Matching
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  The crucial step for localization is to match the current observation to the map. When the two sensor modalities are significantly different, matching becomes challenging. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep phase correlation network (DPCN) to match heterogeneous sensor measurements. In DPCN, the primary component is a differentiable correlation-based estimator that back-propagates the pose error to learnable feature extractors, which addresses the problem that there are no direct common features for supervision. In addition, it eliminates the exhaustive evaluation in some previous methods, improving efficiency. With the interpretable modeling, the network is light-weighted and promising for better generalization. We evaluate the system on both the simulation data and Aero-Ground Dataset which consists of heterogeneous sensor images and aerial images acquired by satellites or aerial robots. The results show that our method is able to match the heterogeneous sensor measurements, outperforming the comparative traditional phase correlation and other learning-based methods.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 249: Incremental learning of EMG-based control commands using Gaussian Processes
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Myoelectric control is the process of controlling a prosthesis or an assistive robot by using electrical signals of the muscles. Pattern recognition in myoelectric control is a challenging field, since the underlying distribution of the signal is likely to change during the application. Covariate shifts, including changes of the arm position or different levels of muscular activation, often lead to significant instability of the control signal. This work tries to overcome these challenges by enhancing a myoelectric human machine interface through the use of the sparse Gaussian Process (sGP) approximation Variational Free Energy and by the introduction of a novel adaptive model based on an unsupervised incremental learning approach. The novel adaptive model integrates an interclass and intraclass distance to improve prediction stability under challenging conditions. Furthermore, it demonstrates the successful incorporation of incremental updates which is shown to lead to a significantly increased performance and higher  stability of the predictions in an online user study.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 248: Generation of Realistic Images for Learning in Simulation using FeatureGAN
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  This paper presents FeatureGan, a methodology to train image translators (generators) using an unpaired image training set. FeatureGan is based on the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and has three main novel components: (i) the use of a feature loss to ensure alignment between the input and the generated image, (ii) the use of a feature pyramid discriminator, which uses a tensor composed of features at different levels of ion generated by a pre-trained network, and (iii) the introduction of a per class loss to improve the results in the simulation-to-reality task. The main advantage of the proposed methodology when compared to classical approaches is a more stable training process, which includes a higher resilience to common GAN problems such as mode collapse, as well as better and more consistent results. FeatureGan is also fast to train, easy to replicate, and especially suited to be used in simulation-to-reality applications where the generated realistic images allow to close the visual simulation-to-reality gap. As a proof of concept, we show the application of the proposed methodology in soccer robotics, where realistic images are generated in a soccer robotics simulator, and robot and ball detectors are trained using these images and then tested in reality. The same methodology is used to generate realistic images from images rendered in a video game. The realistic images are then used to train a semantic segmentation network.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 239: IV-SLAM: Introspective Vision for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Existing solutions to visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM) assume that errors in feature extraction and matching are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), but this assumption is known to not be true - features extracted from low-contrast regions of images exhibit wider error distributions than features from sharp corners. Furthermore, V-SLAM algorithms are prone to catastrophic tracking failures when sensed images include challenging conditions such as specular reflections, lens flare, or shadows of dynamic objects. To address such failures, previous work has focused on building more robust visual frontends, to filter out challenging features. In this paper, we present introspective vision for SLAM (IV-SLAM), a fundamentally different approach for addressing these challenges. IV-SLAM explicitly models the noise process of reprojection errors from visual features to be context-dependent, and hence non-i.i.d. We introduce an autonomously supervised approach for IV-SLAM to collect training data to learn such a context-aware noise model. Using this learned noise model, IV-SLAM guides feature extraction to select more features from parts of the image that are likely to result in lower noise, and further incorporate the learned noise model into the joint maximum likelihood estimation, thus making it robust to the aforementioned types of errors. We present empirical results to demonstrate that IV-SLAM 1) is able to accurately predict sources of error in input images, 2) reduces tracking error compared to V-SLAM, and 3) increases the mean distance between tracking failures by more than 70% on challenging real robot data compared to V-SLAM.

authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  In this paper, we present Asynchronous implementation of Deep Neural Network-based Model Reference Adaptive Control (DMRAC). We evaluate this new neuro-adaptive control architecture through flight tests on a small quadcopter. We demonstrate that a single DMRAC controller can handle significant nonlinearities due to severe system faults and deliberate wind disturbances while executing high-bandwidth attitude control. We also show that the architecture has long-term learning abilities across different flight regimes, and can generalize to fly different flight trajectories than those on which it was trained. These results demonstrating the efficacy of this architecture for high bandwidth closed-loop attitude control of unstable and nonlinear robots operating in adverse situations. To achieve these results, we designed a software+communication architecture to ensure online real-time inference of the deep network on a high-bandwidth computation-limited platform. We expect that this architecture will benefit other deep learning in the closed-loop experiments on robots.

authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  Sound is an information-rich medium that captures dynamic physical events. This work presents STReSSD, a framework that uses sound to bridge the simulation-to-reality gap for stochastic dynamics, demonstrated for the canonical case of a bouncing ball. A physically-motivated noise model is presented to capture stochastic behavior of the balls upon collision with the environment. A likelihood-free Bayesian inference framework is used to infer the parameters of the noise model, as well as a material property called the coefficient of restitution, from audio observations.  The same inference framework and the calibrated stochastic simulator are then used to learn a probabilistic model of ball dynamics.  The predictive capabilities of the dynamics model are tested in two robotic experiments. First, open-loop predictions anticipate probabilistic success of bouncing a ball into a cup. The second experiment integrates audio perception with a robotic arm to track and deflect a bouncing ball in real-time. We envision that this work is a step towards integrating audio-based inference for dynamic robotic tasks.

title:  Learning Dexterous Manipulation from Suboptimal Experts
authors:  Rae Jeong
abstract:  Learning dexterous manipulation in high-dimensional state-action spaces is an important open challenge with exploration presenting a major bottleneck. Although in many cases the learning process could be guided by demonstrations or other suboptimal experts, current RL algorithms for continuous action spaces often fail to effectively utilize combinations of highly off-policy expert data and on-policy exploration data. As a solution, we introduce Relative Entropy Q-Learning (REQ), a simple policy iteration algorithm that combines ideas from successful offline and conventional RL algorithms. It represents the optimal policy via importance sampling from a learned prior and is well-suited to take advantage of mixed data distributions. We demonstrate experimentally that REQ outperforms several strong baselines on robotic manipulation tasks for which suboptimal experts are available. We show how suboptimal experts can be constructed effectively by composing simple waypoint tracking controllers, and we also show how learned primitives can be combined with waypoint controllers to obtain reference behaviors to bootstrap a complex manipulation task on a simulated bimanual robot with human-like hands. Finally, we show that REQ is also effective for general off-policy RL, offline RL, and RL from demonstrations.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In this paper, we propose a multi-resolution deep-learning architecture to segment dense large-scale pointclouds semantically. Dense pointcloud data require a computationally expensive feature encoding process before semantic segmentation. Previous work has used different approaches to drastically downsample from the original pointcloud to utilize common computing hardware. While these approaches can relieve the computation burden to some extent, they are still limited in their processing capability for multiple scans. We present MuGNet, a memory-efficient, end-to-end graph neural network framework to perform semantic segmentation on large-scale pointclouds. We reduce the computation demand by utilizing a graph neural network on the preformed pointcloud graphs and retain the segmentation's precision with a bidirectional network that fuses feature embedding at different resolutions. Our framework has been validated on benchmark datasets, including Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces Dataset(S3DIS) and Virtual KITTI Dataset. We demonstrate that our framework can process up to 45 room scans at once on a single 11 GB GPU while still surpassing other graph-based solutions for segmentation on S3DIS with an 88.5% (+3%) overall accuracy and 69.8% (+7.7%) mIOU accuracy.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 385: Learning a natural-language to LTL executable semantic parser for grounded robotics
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Children acquire their native language with apparent ease by observing how language is used in context and attempting to use it themselves. They do so without laborious annotations, negative examples, or even direct corrections. We take a step toward robots that can do the same by training a grounded semantic parser, which discovers latent linguistic representations that can be used for the execution of  natural-language commands. In particular, we focus on the difficult domain of commands with a temporal aspect, whose semantics we capture with Linear Temporal Logic, LTL. Our parser is trained with pairs of sentences and executions as well as an executor. At training time, the parser hypothesizes a meaning representation for the input as a formula in LTL. Three competing pressures allow the parser to discover  meaning from language. First, any hypothesized meaning for a sentence must be permissive enough to reflect all the annotated execution trajectories. Second, the executor - a pretrained end-to-end LTL planner - must find that the observed trajectories are  likely executions of the meaning. Finally, a generator, which reconstructs the original input, encourages the model to find representations that conserve knowledge about the command. Together these ensure that the meaning is neither too general nor too specific. Our model generalizes well, being able to parse and execute both machine-generated and human-generated commands, with near-equal accuracy, despite the fact that the human-generated sentences are much more varied and complex with an open lexicon. The approach presented here is not specific to LTL: it can be applied to any domain where sentence meanings can be hypothesized and  an executor can verify these meanings, thus opening the door to many applications for robotic agents.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 386: PLAS: Latent Action Space for Offline Reinforcement Learning
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  The goal of offline reinforcement learning is to learn a policy from a fixed dataset, without further interactions with the environment. This setting will be an increasingly more important paradigm for real-world applications of reinforcement learning such as robotics, in which data collection is slow and potentially dangerous. Existing off-policy algorithms have limited performance on static datasets due to extrapolation errors from out-of-distribution actions. This leads to the challenge of constraining the policy to select actions within the support of the dataset during training. We propose to simply learn the Policy in the Latent Action Space (PLAS) such that this requirement is naturally satisfied. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks in simulation and a deformable object manipulation task with a physical robot. We demonstrate that our method provides competitive performance consistently across various continuous control tasks and different types of datasets, outperforming existing offline reinforcement learning methods with explicit constraints.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 389: Unsupervised Metric Relocalization Using Transform Consistency Loss
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Training networks to perform metric relocalization traditionally requires accurate image correspondences. In practice, these are obtained by restricting domain coverage, employing additional sensors, or capturing large multi-view datasets. We instead propose a self-supervised solution, which exploits a key insight: localizing a query image within a map should yield the same absolute pose, regardless of the reference image used for registration. Guided by this intuition, we derive a novel transform consistency loss. Using this loss function, we train a deep neural network to infer dense feature and saliency maps to perform robust metric relocalization in dynamic environments.  We evaluate our framework on synthetic and real-world data, showing our approach outperforms other supervised methods when a limited amount of ground-truth information is available.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 516: Multi-Level Structure vs. End-to-End-Learning in High-Performance Tactile Robotic Manipulation
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In this paper we apply a multi-level structure to robotic manipulation learning. It consists of a hybrid dynamical system we denote skill and a parameter learning layer that leverages the underlying structure to simplify the problem at hand. For the learning layer we introduce a novel algorithm based on the idea of learning to partition the parameter solution space to quickly and efficiently find good and robust solutions to complex manipulation problems. In a benchmark comparison we show a significant performance increase compared with other black-box optimization algorithms such as HiREPS and particle swarm optimization. Furthermore, we validate and compare our approach on a very hard real-world manipulation problem, namely inserting a key into a lock, with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning.

abstract:  To determine if a skill can be executed in any given environment, a robot needs to learn the preconditions for the skill. As robots begin to operate in dynamic and unstructured environments, these precondition models will need to generalize to variable number of objects with different shapes and sizes. In this work, we focus on learning precondition models for manipulation skills in unconstrained environments.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 171: Safe Policy Learning for Continuous Control
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We study continuous action reinforcement learning problems in which it is crucial that the agent interacts with the environment only through near-safe policies, i.e.,~policies that keep the agent in desirable situations, both during training and at convergence. We formulate these problems as constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) and present safe policy optimization algorithms that are based on a Lyapunov approach to solve them. Our algorithms can use any standard policy gradient (PG) method, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) or proximal policy optimization (PPO), to train a neural network policy, while enforcing near-constraint satisfaction for every policy update by projecting either the policy parameter or the selected action onto the set of feasible solutions induced by the state-dependent linearized Lyapunov constraints. Compared to the existing constrained PG algorithms, ours are more data efficient as they are able to utilize both on-policy and off-policy data. Moreover, in practice our action-projection algorithm often leads to less conservative policy updates and allows for natural integration into an end-to-end PG training pipeline. We evaluate our algorithms and compare them with the state-of-the-art baselines on several simulated (MuJoCo) tasks, as well as a real-world robot obstacle-avoidance problem, demonstrating their effectiveness in terms of balancing performance and constraint satisfaction.

abstract:  We proposed an end-to-end grasp detection network,  Grasp Detection Network (GDN), cooperated with a novel coarse-to-fine (C2F) grasp representation design to detect diverse and accurate 6-DoF grasps based on point clouds.   Compared to previous two-stage approaches which sample and evaluate multiple grasp candidates, our architecture is at least 20 times faster.  It is also 8% and 40% more accurate in terms of the success rate in single object scenes and the complete rate in clutter scenes, respectively. Our method shows superior results among settings with different number of views and input points.  Moreover, we propose a new AP-based metric which considers both rotation and transition errors, making it a more comprehensive evaluation tool for grasp detection models.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 35: Learning 3D Dynamic Scene Representations for Robot Manipulation
authors:  CoRL2020
abstract:  3D scene representation for robot manipulation should capture three key object properties: permanency – objects that become occluded over time continue to exist; amodal completeness – objects have 3D occupancy, even if only partial observations are available; spatiotemporal continuity – the movement of each object is continuous over space and time. In this paper, we introduce 3D Dynamic Scene Representation (DSR), a 3D volumetric scene representation that simultaneously discovers, tracks, reconstructs objects, and predicts their dynamics while capturing all three properties. We further propose DSR-Net, which learns to aggregate visual observations over multiple interactions to gradually build and refine DSR. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling 3D scene dynamics with DSR on both simulated and real data. Combined with model predictive control, DSR-Net enables accurate planning in downstream robotic manipulation tasks such as planar pushing. Code and data are available at dsr-net.cs.columbia.edu.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 499: MATS: An Interpretable Trajectory Forecasting Representation for Planning and Control
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Reasoning about human motion is a core component of modern human-robot interactive systems. In particular, one of the main uses of behavior prediction in autonomous systems is to inform robot motion planning and control. However, a majority of planning and control algorithms reason about system dynamics rather than the predicted agent tracklets (i.e., ordered sets of waypoints) that are commonly output by trajectory forecasting methods, which can hinder their integration. Towards this end, we propose Mixtures of Affine Time-varying Systems (MATS) as an output representation for trajectory forecasting that is more amenable to downstream planning and control use. Our approach leverages successful ideas from probabilistic trajectory forecasting works to learn dynamical system representations that are well-studied in the planning and control literature. We integrate our predictions with a proposed multimodal planning methodology and demonstrate significant computational efficiency improvements on a large-scale autonomous driving dataset.

abstract:  We propose a Deep RObust Goal-Oriented trajectory prediction Network (DROGON) for accurate vehicle trajectory prediction by considering behavioral intentions of vehicles in traffic scenes. Our main insight is that the behavior (i.e., motion) of drivers can be reasoned from their high level possible goals (i.e., intention) on the road. To succeed in such behavior reasoning, we build a conditional prediction model to forecast goal-oriented trajectories with the following stages: (i) relational inference where we encode relational interactions of vehicles using the perceptual context; (ii) intention estimation to compute the probability distributions of intentional goals based on the inferred relations; and (iii) behavior reasoning where we reason about the behaviors of vehicles as trajectories conditioned on the intentions. To this end, we extend the proposed framework to the pedestrian trajectory prediction task, showing the potential applicability toward

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In this paper, with a view toward fast deployment of locomotion gaits in low-cost hardware, we use a linear policy for realizing end-foot trajectories in the quadruped robot, Stoch 2. In particular, the parameters of the end-foot trajectories are shaped via a linear feedback policy that takes the torso orientation and the terrain slope as inputs. The corresponding desired joint angles are obtained via an inverse kinematics solver and tracked via a PID control law. Augmented Random Search, a model-free and a gradient-free learning algorithm is used to train this linear policy. Simulation results show that the resulting walking is robust to terrain slope variations and external pushes. This methodology is not only computationally light-weight but also uses minimal sensing and actuation capabilities in the robot, thereby justifying the approach.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In this paper, we present LiRaNet, a novel end-to-end trajectory prediction method which utilizes radar sensor information along with widely used lidar and HD maps. Automotive radar provides rich, complementary information, allowing for longer range vehicle detection as well as instantaneous radial velocity measurements. However, there are factors that make the fusion of lidar and radar information challenging, such as the relatively low angular resolution of radar measurements, their sparsity and the lack of exact time synchronization with lidar. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal radar feature extraction scheme which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple large-scale datasets. Further, by incorporating radar information, we show a 52% reduction in prediction error for objects with high acceleration and a 16% reduction in prediction error for objects at longer range.

abstract:  We present Model-Predictive Interaction Primitives - a robot learning framework for assistive motion in human-machine collaboration tasks which explicitly accounts for biomechanical impact on the human musculoskeletal system. First, we extend Interaction Primitives to enable predictive biomechanics: the prediction of future biomechanical states of a human partner conditioned on current observations and intended robot control signals. In turn, we leverage this capability within a model-predictive control strategy to identify the future ergonomic and biomechanical ramifications of potential robot actions. Optimal control trajectories are selected so as to minimize future physical impact on the human musculoskeletal system. We empirically demonstrate that our approach minimizes knee or muscle forces via generated control actions selected according to biomechanical cost functions. Experiments are performed in synthetic and real-world experiments involving powered prosthetic devices.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Many autonomous systems forecast aspects of the future in order to aid decision-making. For example, self-driving vehicles and robotic manipulation systems often forecast future object poses by first detecting and tracking objects. However, this detect-then-forecast pipeline is expensive to scale, as pose forecasting algorithms typically require labeled sequences of object poses, which are costly to obtain in 3D space. Can we scale performance without requiring additional labels? We hypothesize yes, and propose inverting the detect-then-forecast pipeline. Instead of detecting, tracking and then forecasting the objects, we propose to first forecast 3D sensor data (e.g., point clouds with 100k points) and then detect/track objects on the predicted point cloud sequences to obtain future poses, i.e., a forecast-then-detect pipeline. This inversion makes it less expensive to scale pose forecasting, as the sensor data forecasting task requires no labels. Part of this work's focus is on the challenging first step - Sequential Pointcloud Forecasting (SPF), for which we also propose an effective approach, SPFNet. To compare our forecast-then-detect pipeline relative to the detect-then-forecast pipeline, we propose an evaluation procedure and two metrics. Through experiments on a robotic manipulation dataset and two driving datasets, we show that SPFNet is effective for the SPF task, our forecast-then-detect pipeline outperforms the detect-then-forecast approaches to which we compared, and that pose forecasting performance improves with the addition of unlabeled data.

abstract:  Common methods for learning robot dynamics assume motion is continuous, causing unrealistic model predictions for systems undergoing discontinuous impact and stiction behavior. In this work, we resolve this conflict with a smooth, implicit encoding of the structure inherent to contact-induced discontinuities. Our method, ContactNets, learns parameterizations of inter-body signed distance and contact-frame Jacobians, a representation that is compatible with many simulation, control, and planning environments for robotics. We furthermore circumvent the need to differentiate through stiff or non-smooth dynamics with a novel loss function inspired by the principles of complementarity and maximum dissipation. Our method can predict realistic impact, non-penetration, and stiction when trained on 60 seconds of real-world data.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Constrained robot motion planning is a widely used technique to solve complex robot tasks. We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 528: Towards Autonomous Eye Surgery by Combining Deep Imitation Learning with Optimal Control
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  During retinal microsurgery, precise manipulation of the delicate retinal tissue is required for positive surgical outcome. However, accurate manipulation and navigation of surgical tools remain difficult due to a constrained workspace and the top-down view during the surgery, which limits the surgeon’s ability to estimate depth. To alleviate such difficulty, we propose to automate the tool-navigation task by learning to predict relative goal position on the retinal surface from the current tool-tip position. Given an estimated target on the retina, we generate an optimal trajectory leading to the predicted goal while imposing safety-related physical constraints aimed to minimize tissue damage. As an extended task, we generate goal predictions to various points across the retina to localize eye geometry and further generate safe trajectories within the estimated confines. Through experiments in both simulation and with several eye phantoms, we demonstrate that our framework can permit navigation to various points on the retina within 0.089mm and 0.118mm in xy error which is less than the human’s surgeon mean tremor at the tool-tip of 0.180mm. All safety constraints were fulfilled and the algorithm was robust to previously unseen eyes as well as unseen objects in the scene.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  With the increasing reliance of self-driving and similar robotic systems on robust 3D vision, the processing of LiDAR scans with deep convolutional neural networks has become a trend in academia and industry alike. Prior attempts on the challenging Semantic Scene Completion task - which entails the inference of dense 3D structure and associated semantic labels from ""sparse"" representations - have been, to a degree, successful in small indoor scenes when provided with dense point clouds or dense depth maps often fused with semantic segmentation maps from RGB images. However, the performance of these systems drop drastically when applied to large outdoor scenes characterized by dynamic and exponentially sparser conditions. Likewise, processing of the entire sparse volume becomes infeasible due to memory limitations and workarounds introduce computational inefficiency as practitioners are forced to divide the overall volume into multiple equal segments and infer on each individually, rendering real-time performance impossible. In this work, we formulate a method that subsumes the sparsity of large-scale environments and present S3CNet, a sparse convolution based neural network that predicts the semantically completed scene from a single, unified LiDAR point cloud. We show that our proposed method outperforms all counterparts on the 3D task, achieving state-of-the art results on the SemanticKITTI benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a 2D variant of S3CNet with a multi-view fusion strategy to complement our 3D network, providing robustness to occlusions and extreme sparsity in distant regions. We conduct experiments for the 2D semantic scene completion task and compare the results of our sparse 2D network against several leading LiDAR segmentation models adapted for bird's eye view segmentation on two open-source datasets.

abstract:  Reinforcement learning has been applied to a wide variety of robotics problems, but most of such applications involve collecting data from scratch for each new task. Since the amount of robot data we can collect for any single task is limited by time and cost considerations, the learned behavior is typically narrow: the policy can only execute the task in a handful of scenarios that it was trained on. What if there was a way to incorporate a large amount of prior data, either from previously solved tasks or from unsupervised or undirected environment interaction, to extend and generalize learned behaviors?

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 482: Differentiable Logic Layer for Rule Guided Trajectory Prediction
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In this work, we propose a method for integration of temporal logic formulas into a neural network. Our main contribution is a new logic optimization layer that uses differentiable optimization on the formulas’ robustness function. This allows incorporating traffic rules into deep learning based trajectory prediction approaches. In the forward pass, an initial prediction from a base predictor is used to initialize and guide the robustness optimization process. Backpropagation through the logic layer allows for simultaneously adjusting the parameters of the rules and the initial prediction network. The integration of a logic layer affords both improved predictions, as well as quantification rule satisfaction and violation during predictor execution. As such, it can serve as a parametric safety- envelope for black box behavior models. We demonstrate how integrating traffic rules improves the predictor performance using real traffic data from the NuScenes dataset.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 30: Learning a Decentralized Multi-Arm Motion Planner
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We present a closed-loop multi-arm motion planner that is scalable and flexible with team size. Traditional multi-arm robotic systems have relied on centralized motion planners, whose run times often scale exponentially with team size, and thus, fail to handle dynamic environments with open-loop control. In this paper, we tackle this problem with multi-agent reinforcement learning, where a shared policy network is trained to control each individual robot arm to reach its target end-effector pose given observations of its workspace state and target end-effector pose. The policy is trained using Soft Actor-Critic with expert demonstrations from a sampling-based motion planning algorithm (i.e., BiRRT). By leveraging classical planning algorithms, we can improve the learning efficiency of the reinforcement learning algorithm while retaining the fast inference time of neural networks. The resulting policy scales sub-linearly and can be deployed on multi-arm systems with variable team sizes. Thanks to the closed-loop and decentralized formulation, our approach generalizes to 5-10 multiarm systems and dynamic moving targets (less than 90% success rate for a 10-arm system), despite being trained on only 1-4 arm planning tasks with static targets.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 487: Attentional Separation-and-Aggregation Network for Self-supervised Depth-Pose Learning in Dynamic Scenes
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Learning depth and ego-motion from unlabeled videos via self-supervision from epipolar projection can improve the robustness and accuracy of the 3D perception and localization of vision-based robots. However, the rigid projection computed by ego-motion cannot represent all scene points, such as points on moving objects, leading to false guidance in these regions. To address this problem, we propose an Attentional Separation-and-Aggregation Network (ASANet), which can learn to distinguish and extract the scene's static and dynamic characteristics via the attention mechanism. We further propose a novel MotionNet with an ASANet as the encoder, followed by two separate decoders, to estimate the camera's ego-motion and the scene's dynamic motion field. Then, we introduce an auto-selecting approach to detect the moving objects for dynamic-aware learning automatically. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We focus on decentralized navigation among multiple non-communicating rational agents at uncontrolled intersections, i.e., street intersections without traffic signs or signals. Avoiding collisions in such domains relies on the ability of agents to predict each others' intentions reliably, and react quickly. Multiagent trajectory prediction is NP-hard whereas the sample complexity of existing data-driven approaches limits their applicability. Our key insight is that the geometric structure of the intersection and the incentive of agents to move efficiently and avoid collisions (rationality) reduces the space of likely behaviors, effectively relaxing the problem of trajectory prediction. In this paper, we collapse the space of multiagent trajectories at an intersection into a set of modes representing different classes of multiagent behavior, formalized using a notion of topological invariance. Based on this formalism, we design Multiple Topologies Prediction (MTP), a data-driven trajectory-prediction mechanism that reconstructs trajectory representations of high-likelihood modes in multiagent intersection scenes. We show that MTP outperforms a state-of-the-art multimodal trajectory prediction baseline (MFP) in terms of prediction accuracy by 78.24% on a challenging simulated dataset. Finally, we show that MTP enables our optimization-based planner, MTPnav, to achieve collision-free and time-efficient navigation across a variety of challenging intersection scenarios on the CARLA simulator.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 28: From pixels to legs: Hierarchical learning of quadruped locomotion
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Legged robots navigating crowded scenes and complex terrains in the real world are required to execute dynamic leg movements while processing visual input for obstacle avoidance and path planning. We show that a quadruped robot can acquire both of these skills by means of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). By virtue of their hierarchical structure, our policies learn to implicitly break down this joint problem by concurrently learning High Level (HL) and Low Level (LL) neural network policies. These two levels are connected by a low dimensional hidden layer, which we call latent command. HL receives a first-person camera view, whereas LL receives the latent command from HL and the robot's on-board sensors to control its actuators. We train policies to walk in two different environments: a curved cliff and a maze. We show that hierarchical policies can concurrently learn to locomote and navigate in these environments, and show they are more efficient than non-hierarchical neural network policies. This architecture also allows for knowledge reuse across tasks. LL networks trained on one task can be transferred to a new task in a new environment. Finally HL, which processes camera images, can be evaluated at much lower and varying frequencies compared to LL, thus reducing computation times and bandwidth requirements.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 25: Augmenting GAIL with BC for sample efficient imitation learning
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Imitation learning is the problem of recovering an expert policy without access to a reward signal. Behavior cloning and GAIL are two widely used methods for performing imitation learning. Behavior cloning converges in a few iterations, but doesn't achieve peak performance due to its inherent iid assumption about the state-action distribution. GAIL addresses the issue by accounting for the temporal dependencies when performing a state distribution matching between the agent and the expert. Although GAIL is sample efficient in the number of expert trajectories required, it is still not very sample efficient in terms of the environment interactions needed for convergence of the policy. Given the complementary benefits of both methods, we present a simple and elegant method to combine both methods to enable stable and sample efficient learning. Our algorithm is very simple to implement and integrates with different policy gradient algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in low dimensional control tasks, gridworlds and in high dimensional image-based tasks.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Learning-from-demonstrations is an emerging paradigm to obtain effective robot control policies for complex tasks via reinforcement learning without the need to explicitly design reward functions. However, it is susceptible to imperfections in demonstrations and also raises concerns of safety and interpretability in the learned control policies. To address these issues, we use Signal Temporal Logic to evaluate and rank the quality of demonstrations. Temporal logic-based specifications allow us to create non-Markovian rewards, and also define interesting causal dependencies between tasks such as sequential task specifications. We validate our approach through experiments on discrete-world and OpenAI Gym environments, and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  The interpretation of ego motion and scene change is a fundamental task for mobile robots. Optical flow information can be employed to estimate motion in the surroundings. Recently, unsupervised optical flow estimation has become a research hotspot.  However, unsupervised approaches are often easy to be unreliable on partially occluded or texture-less regions. To deal with this problem, we propose CoT-AMFlow in this paper, an unsupervised optical flow estimation approach. In terms of the network architecture, we develop an adaptive modulation network that employs two novel module types, flow modulation modules (FMMs) and cost volume modulation modules (CMMs), to remove outliers in challenging regions. As for the training paradigm, we adopt a co-teaching strategy, where two networks simultaneously teach each other about challenging regions to further improve accuracy. Experimental results on the MPI Sintel, KITTI Flow and Middlebury Flow benchmarks demonstrate that our CoT-AMFlow outperforms all other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, while still running in real time.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We describe a policy learning approach to map visual inputs to driving controls conditioned on turning command that leverages side tasks on semantics and object affordances via a learned representation trained for driving. To learn this representation, we train a squeeze network to drive using annotations for the side task as input. This representation encodes the driving-relevant information associated with the side task while ideally throwing out side task-relevant but driving-irrelevant nuisances. We then train a mimic network to drive using only images as input and use the squeeze network's latent representation to supervise the mimic network via a mimicking loss. Notably, we do not aim to achieve the side task nor to learn features for it; instead, we aim to learn, via the mimicking loss, a representation of the side task annotations directly useful for driving. We test our approach using the CARLA simulator. In addition, we introduce a more challenging but realistic evaluation protocol that considers a run that reaches the destination successful only if it does not violate common traffic rules.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 476:Explicitly Encouraging Low Fractional Dimensional Trajectories Via Reinforcement Learning
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  A key limitation in using various modern methods of machine learning in developing feedback control policies is the lack of appropriate methodologies to analyze their long-term dynamics, in terms of making any sort of guarantees (even statistically) about robustness.  The central reasons for this are largely due to the so-called curse of dimensionality, combined with the black-box nature of the resulting control policies themselves. This paper aims at the first of these issues. Although the full state space of a system may be quite large in dimensionality, it is a common feature of most model-based control methods that the resulting closed-loop systems demonstrate dominant dynamics that are rapidly driven to some lower-dimensional sub-space within. In this work we argue that the dimensionality of this subspace is captured by tools from fractal geometry, namely various notions of a fractional dimension. We then show that the dimensionality of trajectories induced by model free reinforcement learning agents can be influenced adding a post processing function to the agents reward signal. We verify that the dimensionality reduction is robust to noise being added to the system and show that that the modified agents are more actually more robust to noise and push disturbances in general for the systems we examined.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 41: Fit2Form: 3D Generative Model for Robot Gripper Form Design
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  The 3D shape of a robot's end-effector plays a critical role in determining it's functionality and overall performance. Many of today's industrial applications rely on highly customized gripper design for a given task to ensure the system's robustness and accuracy.  However, the process of manual hardware design is both costly and time-consuming, and the quality of the design is also dependent on the engineer's experience and domain expertise, which can easily be out-dated or inaccurate.  The goal of this paper is to use machine learning algorithms to automate this design process and generate task-specific gripper designs that satisfy a set of pre-defined design objectives. We model the design objectives by training a Fitness network to predict their values for a pair of gripper fingers and a grasp object. This Fitness network is then used to provide training supervision to a 3D Generative network that produces a pair of 3D finger geometries for the target grasp object. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D generative design framework generates parallel jaw gripper finger shapes that achieve more stable and robust grasps as compared to other general-purpose and task-specific gripper design algorithms.

title:  [CoRL 2020 Best Paper Presentation Award] Accelerating Reinforcement Learning with Learned Skill Priors
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Intelligent agents rely heavily on prior experience when learning a new task, yet most modern reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn every task from scratch. One approach for leveraging prior knowledge is to transfer skills learned on prior tasks to the new task. However, as the amount of prior experience increases, the number of transferable skills grows too, making it challenging to explore the full set of available skills during downstream learning. Yet, intuitively, not all skills should be explored with equal probability; for example information about the current state can hint which skills are promising to explore. In this work, we propose to implement this intuition by learning a prior over skills. We propose a deep latent variable model that jointly learns an embedding space of skills and the skill prior from offline agent experience. We then extend common maximum-entropy RL approaches to use skill priors to guide downstream learning. We validate our approach, SPiRL (Skill-Prior RL), on complex navigation and robotic manipulation tasks and show that learned skill priors are essential for effective skill transfer from rich datasets.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Learning reward functions from data is a promising path towards achieving scalable Reinforcement Learning (RL) for robotics. However, a major challenge in training agents from learned reward models is that the agent can learn to exploit errors in the reward model to achieve high reward behaviors that do not correspond to the intended task. These reward delusions can lead to unintended and even dangerous behaviors. On the other hand, adversarial imitation learning frameworks (Ho et al., 2016) tend to suffer the opposite problem, where the discriminator learns to trivially distinguish agent and expert behavior, resulting in reward models that produce low reward signal regardless of the input state.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 467: Never Stop Learning: The Effectiveness of Fine-Tuning in Robotic Reinforcement Learning
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  One of the great promises of robot learning systems is that they will be able to learn from their mistakes and continuously adapt to ever-changing environments. Despite this potential, most of the robot learning systems today produce static policies that are not further adapted during deployment, because the algorithms which produce those policies are not designed for continual adaptation. We present an adaptation method, and empirical evidence that it supports a robot learning framework for continual adaption. We show that this very simple method–fine-tuning off-policy reinforcement learning using offline datasets–is robust to changes in background, object shape and appearance, lighting conditions, and robot morphology. We demonstrate how to adapt vision-based robotic manipulation policies to new variations using less than 0.2% of the data necessary to learn the task from scratch. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this robustness holds in an episodic continual learning setting. We also show that pre-training via RL is essential: training from scratch or adapting from super vised ImageNet features are both unsuccessful with such small amounts of data. Our empirical conclusions are consistently supported by experiments on simulated manipulation tasks, and by 60 unique fine-tuning experiments on a real robotic grasping system pre-trained on 580,000 grasps.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 49: Action-based Representation Learning for Autonomous Driving
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Human drivers produce a vast amount of data which could, in principle, be used to improve autonomous driving systems. Unfortunately, seemingly straightforward approaches for creating end-to-end driving models that map sensor data directly into driving actions are problematic in terms of interpretability, and typically have significant difficulty dealing with spurious correlations. Alternatively, we propose to use this kind of action-based driving data for learning representations. Our experiments show that an affordance-based driving model pre-trained with this approach can leverage a relatively small amount of weakly annotated imagery and outperform pure end-to-end driving models, while being more interpretable. Further, we demonstrate how this strategy outperforms previous methods based on learning inverse dynamics models as well as other methods based on heavy human supervision (ImageNet).

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 50: Task-Relevant Adversarial Imitation Learning
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We show that a critical vulnerability in adversarial imitation is the tendency of discriminator networks to learn spurious associations between visual features and expert labels. When the discriminator focuses on task-irrelevant features, it does not provide an informative reward signal, leading to poor task performance. We analyze this problem in detail and propose a solution that outperforms standard Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). Our proposed method, Task-Relevant Adversarial Imitation Learning (TRAIL), uses constrained discriminator optimization to learn informative rewards. In comprehensive experiments, we show that TRAIL can solve challenging robotic manipulation tasks from pixels by imitating human operators without access to any task rewards, and clearly outperforms comparable baseline imitation agents, including those trained via behavior cloning and conventional GAIL.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Detecting and matching robust viewpoint-invariant keypoints is critical for visual SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. State-of-the-art learning-based methods generate training samples via homography adaptation to create 2D synthetic views with known keypoint matches from a single image. This approach does not, however, generalize to non-planar 3D scenes with illumination variations commonly seen in real-world videos. In this work, we propose self-supervised learning depth-aware keypoints from unlabeled videos directly. We jointly learn keypoint and depth estimation networks by combining appearance and geometric matching via a differentiable structure-from-motion module based on Procrustean residual pose correction. We show how our self-supervised keypoints can be trivially incorporated into state-of-the-art visual odometry frameworks for robust and accurate ego-motion estimation of autonomous vehicles in real-world conditions.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  To navigate safely in urban environments, an autonomous vehicle (ego vehicle) must understand and anticipate its surroundings, in particular the behavior and intents of other road users (neighbors). Most of the times, multiple decision choices are acceptable for all road users (e.g., turn right or left, or different ways of avoiding an obstacle), leading to a highly uncertain and multi-modal decision space. We focus here on predicting multiple feasible future trajectories for both ego vehicle and neighbors through a probabilistic framework. We rely on a conditional imitation learning algorithm, conditioned by a navigation command for the ego vehicle (e.g., “turn right”). Our model processes ego vehicle front-facing camera images and bird-eye view grid, computed from Lidar point clouds, with detections of past and present objects, in order to generate multiple trajectories for both ego vehicle and its neighbors. Our approach is computationally efficient and relies only on on-board sensors. We evaluate our method offline on the publicly available dataset nuScenes, achieving state-of-the-art performance, investigate the impact of our architecture choices on online simulated experiments and show preliminary insights for real vehicle control.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Policy learning for delicate industrial insertion tasks (e.g., PC board assembly) is challenging. This paper considers two major problems: how to learn a diversified policy (instead of just one average policy) that can efficiently handle different workpieces with minimum amount of training data, and how to handle defects of workpieces during insertion. To address the problems, we propose tolerance-guided policy learning.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 61: Integrating Egocentric Localization for More Realistic Point-Goal Navigation Agents
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Recent work has presented embodied agents that can navigate to point-goal targets in novel indoor environments with near-perfect accuracy. However, these agents are equipped with idealized sensors for localization and take deterministic actions. This setting is practically sterile by comparison to the dirty reality of noisy sensors and actuations in the real world - wheels can slip, motion sensors have error, actuations can rebound. In this work, we take a step towards this noisy reality, developing point-goal navigation agents that rely on visual estimates of egomotion under noisy action dynamics. We find these agents outperform naive adaptions of current point-goal agents to this setting as well as those incorporating classic localization baselines. Further, our model conceptually divides learning agent dynamics or odometry (where am I?) from task-specific navigation policy (where do I want to go?). This enables a seamless adaption to changing dynamics (a different robot or floor type) by simply re-calibrating the visual odometry model - circumventing the expense of re-training of the navigation policy. Our agent was the runner-up in the PointNav track of CVPR 2020 Habitat Challenge.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 454: Learning Vision-based Reactive Policies for Obstacle Avoidance
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In this paper, we address the problem of vision-based obstacle avoidance for robotic manipulators. This topic poses challenges for both perception and motion generation. While most work in the field aims at improving one of those aspects, we provide a unified framework for approaching this problem. The main goal of this framework is to connect perception and motion by identifying the relationship between the visual input and the corresponding motion representation. To this end, we propose a method for learning reactive obstacle avoidance policies. We evaluate our method on goal-reaching tasks for single and multiple obstacles scenarios. We show the ability of the proposed method to efficiently learn stable obstacle avoidance strategies at a high success rate while maintaining closed-loop responsiveness required for critical applications like human-robot interaction.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Humans are adept at learning new tasks by watching a few instructional videos. On the other hand, robots that learn new actions either require a lot of effort through trial and error, or use expert demonstrations that are challenging to obtain. In this paper, we explore a method that facilitates learning object manipulation skills directly from videos. Leveraging recent advances in 2D visual recognition and differentiable rendering, we develop an optimization based method to estimate a coarse 3D state representation for the hand and the manipulated object(s) without requiring any supervision. We use these trajectories as dense rewards for an agent that learns to mimic them through reinforcement learning. We evaluate our method on simple single- and two-object actions from the Something-Something dataset. Our approach allows an agent to learn actions from single videos, while watching multiple demonstrations makes the policy more robust. We show that policies learned in a simulated environment can be easily transferred to a real robot.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 58: Reconfigurable Voxels: A New Representation for LiDAR-Based Point Clouds
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  LiDAR is an important method for autonomous driving systems to sense the environment. The point clouds obtained by LiDAR typically exhibit sparse and irregular distribution, thus posing great challenges to the detection of 3D objects, especially those that are small and distant. To tackle this difficulty, we propose Reconfigurable Voxels, a new approach to constructing representations from 3D point clouds. Specifically, we devise a biased random walk scheme, which adaptively covers each neighborhood with a fixed number of voxels based on the local spatial distribution and produces a representation by integrating the points in the chosen neighbors. We found empirically that this approach effectively improves the stability of voxel features, especially for sparse regions. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Lyft, and KITTI, show that this new representation can remarkably improve the detection performance for small and distant objects, without incurring noticeable overhead cost.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Reachability analysis is at the core of many applications, from neural network verification, to safe trajectory planning of uncertain systems. However, this problem is notoriously challenging, and current approaches tend to be either too restrictive, too slow, too conservative, or approximate and therefore lack guarantees. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective sampling-based approach to perform reachability analysis for arbitrary dynamical systems. Our key novel idea consists of using random set theory to give a rigorous interpretation of our method, and prove that it returns sets which are guaranteed to converge to the convex hull of the true reachable sets. Additionally, we leverage recent work on robust deep learning and propose a new adversarial sampling approach to robustify our algorithm and accelerate its convergence. We demonstrate that our method is faster and less conservative than prior work, present results for approximate reachability analysis of neural networks and robust trajectory optimization of high-dimensional uncertain nonlinear systems, and discuss future applications.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 463: Transformers for One-Shot Visual Imitation
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Humans are able to seamlessly visually imitate others, by inferring their intentions and using past experience to achieve the same end goal. In other words, we can parse complex semantic knowledge from raw video and efficiently translate that into concrete motor control. Is it possible to give a robot this same capability? Prior research in robot imitation learning has created agents which can acquire diverse skills from expert human operators. However, expanding these techniques to work with a single positive example during test time is still an open challenge. Apart from control, the difficulty stems from mismatches between the demonstrator and robot domains. For example, objects may be placed in different locations (e.g. kitchen layouts are different in every house). Additionally, the demonstration may come from an agent with different morphology and physical appearance (e.g. human), so one-to-one action correspondences are not available. This paper investigates techniques which allow robots to partially bridge these domain gaps, using their past experience. A neural network is trained to mimic ground truth robot actions given context video from another agent, and must generalize to unseen task instances when prompted with new videos during test time. We hypothesize that our policy representations must be both context driven and dynamics aware in order to perform these tasks. These assumptions are baked into the neural network using the Transformers attention mechanism and a self-supervised inverse dynamics loss. Finally, we experimentally determine that our method accomplishes a 2x improvement in terms of task success rate over prior baselines in a suite of one-shot manipulation tasks.

title:  [CoRL 2020 Best System Paper] SMARTS: An Open-Source Scalable Multi-Agent RL Training School for Autonomous Driving
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Interaction is fundamental in autonomous driving (AD). Despite more than a decade of intensive R&D in AD, how to dynamically interact with diverse road users in various contexts still remains unsolved. Multi-agent learning has recently seen big breakthroughs and has much to offer towards solving realistic interaction in AD. However, to realize this potential we need multi-agent AD simulation of realistic interaction. To break this apparent chicken-and-egg circularity, we built an AD simulation platform called SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent Rl Training School), which is designed to accumulate behavior models of road users towards increasingly realistic and diverse interaction that in turn enables deeper and broader multi-agent research on interaction. In this paper, we describe the design goals of SMARTS, explain its key architectural ideas, illustrate its use for multi-agent research through experiments on concrete interaction scenarios, and introduce a set of benchmarks and metrics. As an open-source, industrial-strength platform, the future of SMARTS lies in its growth along with the multi-agent research it enables in the years to come.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 66: Reinforcement Learning with Videos: Combining Offline Observations with Interaction
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Reinforcement learning is a powerful framework for robots to acquire skills from experience, but often requires a substantial amount of online data collection. As a result, it is difficult to collect sufficiently diverse experiences that are needed for robots to generalize broadly. Videos of humans, on the other hand, are a readily available source of broad and interesting experiences. In this paper, we consider the question: can we perform reinforcement learning directly on experience collected by humans? This problem is particularly difficult, as such videos are not annotated with actions and exhibit substantial visual domain shift relative to the robot's embodiment. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for reinforcement learning with videos (RLV).

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Motion planning and obstacle avoidance is a key challenge in robotics applications. While previous work succeeds to provide excellent solutions for known environments, sensor-based motion planning in new and dynamic environments remains to be  difficult. In this work we address sensor-based motion planning from a learning perspective. Motivated by recent advances in visual recognition, we argue the importance of learning appropriate representations for motion planning. We propose a new obstacle representation based on the PointNet architecture and learn it jointly with policies for obstacle avoidance. We experimentally evaluate our approach for rigid body motion planning in challenging environments and demonstrate significant improvements of the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 450: Deep Reinforcement Learning with Population-Coded Spiking Neural N...
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  The energy-efficient control of mobile robots has become crucial as the complexity of their real-world applications increasingly involves high-dimensional observation and action spaces, which cannot be offset by their limited on-board resources. An emerging non-Von Neumann model of intelligence, where spiking neural networks (SNNs) are executed on neuromorphic processors, is now considered as an energy-efficient and robust alternative to the state-of-the-art real-time robotic controllers for low dimensional control tasks. The challenge now for this new computing paradigm is to scale so that it can keep up with real-world applications. To do so, SNNs need to overcome the inherent limitations of their training, namely the limited ability of their spiking neurons to represent information and the lack of effective learning algorithms. Here, we propose a population-coded spiking actor network (PopSAN) that was trained in conjunction with a deep critic network using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The population coding scheme, which is prevalent across brain networks, dramatically increased the representation capacity of the network and the hybrid learning combined the training advantages of deep networks with the energy-efficient inference of spiking networks. To show that our approach can be used for general-purpose spike-based reinforcement learning, we demonstrated its integration with a wide spectrum of policy-gradient based DRL methods covering both on-policy and off-policy DRL algorithms. We deployed the trained PopSAN on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip and benchmarked our method against the mainstream DRL algorithms for continuous control. To allow for a fair comparison among all methods, we validated them on OpenAI gym tasks. Our Loihi-run PopSAN consumed 140 times less energy per inference when compared against the deep actor network on Jetson TX2, and achieved the same level of performance. Our results demonstrate the overall efficiency of neuromorphic controllers and suggest the hybrid reinforcement learning approach as an alternative to deep learning, when both energy-efficiency and robustness are important.

abstract:  Developing agents that can perform complex control tasks from high dimensional observations such as pixels is challenging due to difficulties in learning dynamics efficiently. In this work, we propose to learn forward and inverse dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner via contrastive estimation. Specifically, we train a forward dynamics model and an inverse dynamics model in the feature space of states and actions with data collected from random exploration. Unlike most existing deterministic models, our energy-based model takes into account the stochastic nature of agent-environment interactions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a variety of tasks including goal-directed planning and imitation from observations.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 79: Exploratory Grasping: Asymptotically Optimal Algorithms for Grasping Challenging Polyhedral Objects
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  There has been significant recent work on data-driven algorithms for learning general-purpose grasping policies.  However, these policies can consistently fail to grasp challenging objects which are significantly out of the distribution of objects in the training data or which have very few high quality grasps. Motivated by such objects, we propose a novel problem setting, Exploratory Grasping, for efficiently discovering reliable grasps on an unknown polyhedral object via sequential grasping, releasing, and toppling. We formalize Exploratory Grasping as a Markov Decision Process where we assume that the robot can (1) distinguish stable poses of a polyhedral object of unknown geometry, (2) generate grasp candidates on these poses and execute them, (3) determine whether each grasp is successful, and (4) release the object into a random new pose after a grasp successor topple the object after a grasp failure.  We study the theoretical complexity of Exploratory Grasping in the context of reinforcement learning and present an efficient bandit-style algorithm, Bandits for Online Rapid Grasp ExplorationStrategy (BORGES), which leverages the structure of the problem to efficiently discover high performing grasps for each object stable pose. BORGES can be used to complement any general-purpose grasping algorithm with any grasp modality (parallel-jaw, suction, multi-fingered, etc) to learn policies for objects in which they exhibit persistent failures. Simulation experiments suggest that BORGES can significantly outperform both general-purpose grasping pipelines and two other online learning algorithms and achieves performance within 5% of the optimal policy within 1000 and 8000 timesteps on average across 46 challenging objects from the Dex-Net adversarial and EGAD! object datasets, respectively. Initial physical experiments suggesting that BORGES can improve grasp success rate on average over two challenging 3D printed objects by 45% over a Dex-Net baseline.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 448: DeepMPCVS: Deep Model Predictive Control for Visual Servoing
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  The simplicity of the visual servoing approach makes it an attractive option for tasks dealing with vision-based control of robots in many real-world applications. However, attaining precise alignment for unseen environments pose a challenge to existing visual servoing approaches. While classical approaches assume a perfect world, the recent data-driven approaches face issues when generalizing to novel environments. In this paper, we aim to combine the best of both worlds. We present a deep model predictive visual servoing framework that can achieve precise alignment with optimal trajectories and can generalize to novel environments. Our framework consists of a deep network for optical flow predictions, which are used along with a predictive model to forecast future optical flow. For generating an optimal set of velocities we present a control network that can be trained on-the-fly without any supervision. Through extensive simulations on photo-realistic indoor settings of the popular Habitat framework, we show significant performance gain due to the proposed formulation vis-a-vis recent state of the art methods. Specifically, we show vastly improved performance in trajectory length and faster convergence over recent approaches.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 84: Attention-Privileged Reinforcement Learning
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Image-based Reinforcement Learning is known to suffer from poor sample efficiency and generalisation to unseen visuals such as distractors (task-independent aspects of the observation space). Visual domain randomisation encourages transfer by training over visual factors of variation that may be encountered in the target domain. This increases learning complexity, can negatively impact learning rate and performance, and requires knowledge of potential variations during deployment. In this paper, we introduce Attention-Privileged Reinforcement Learning (APRiL) which uses a self-supervised attention mechanism to significantly alleviate these drawbacks: by focusing on task-relevant aspects of the observations, attention provides robustness to distractors as well as significantly increased learning efficiency. APRiL trains two attention-augmented actor-critic agents: one purely based on image observations, available across training and transfer domains; and one with access to privileged information (such as environment states) available only during training. Experience is shared between both agents and their attention mechanisms are aligned. The image-based policy can then be deployed without access to privileged information. We experimentally demonstrate accelerated and more robust learning on a diverse set of domains, leading to improved final performance for environments both within and outside the training distribution.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 444: Visual Imitation Made Easy
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Visual imitation learning provides a framework for learning complex manipulation behaviors by leveraging human demonstrations. However, current interfaces for imitation such as kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation prohibitively restrict our ability to efficiently collect large-scale data in the wild. Obtaining such diverse demonstration data is paramount for the generalization of learned skills to novel scenarios. In this work, we present an alternate interface for imitation that simplifies the data collection process while allowing for easy transfer to robots. We use commercially available reacher-grabber assistive tools both as a data collection device and as the robot's end-effector. To extract action information from these visual demonstrations, we use off-the-shelf Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques in addition to training a finger detection network. We experimentally evaluate on two challenging tasks: non-prehensile pushing and prehensile stacking, with 1000 diverse demonstrations for each task. For both tasks, we use standard behavior cloning to learn executable policies from the previously collected offline demonstrations. To improve learning performance, we employ a variety of data augmentations and provide an extensive analysis of its effects. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our interface by evaluating on real robotic scenarios with previously unseen objects and achieve a 87% success rate on pushing and a 62% success rate on stacking.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Motivated by the impact of large-scale datasets on ML systems we present the largest self-driving dataset for motion prediction to date, containing over 1,000 hours of data. This was collected by a fleet of 20 autonomous vehicles along a fixed route in Palo Alto, California, over a four-month period. It consists of 170,000 scenes, where each scene is 25 seconds long and captures the perception output of the self-driving system, which encodes the precise positions and motions of nearby vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians over time. On top of this, the dataset contains a high-definition semantic map with 15,242 labelled elements and a high-definition aerial view over the area. We show that using a dataset of this size dramatically improves performance for key self-driving problems. Combined with the provided software kit, this collection forms the largest and most detailed dataset to date for the development of self-driving machine learning tasks, such as motion forecasting, motion planning and simulation.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 442: Hierarchical Robot Navigation in Novel Environments using Rough 2-D Maps
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In robot navigation, generalizing quickly to unseen environments is essential.  Hierarchical methods inspired by human navigation have been proposed, typically consisting of a high-level landmark proposer and a low-level controller. However, these methods either require precise high-level information to be given in advance, or need to construct such guidance from extensive interaction with the environment. In this work, we propose an approach that leverages a rough 2-D map of the environment to navigate in novel environments without requiring further learning. In particular, we introduce a dynamic topological map that can be initialized from the rough 2-D map along with a high-level planning approach for proposing reachable 2-D map patches of the intermediate landmarks between the start and goal locations. To use proposed 2-D patches, we train a deep generative model to generate intermediate landmarks in observation space which are used as subgoals by low-level goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Importantly, because the low-level controller is only trained with local behaviors (e.g. go across the intersection, turn left at a corner) on existing environments, this framework allows us to generalize to novel environments given only a rough 2-D map, without requiring further learning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both seen and novel environments.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 428: BayesRace: Learning to race autonomously using prior experience
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Autonomous race cars require perception, estimation, planning, and control modules which work together asynchronously while driving at the limit of a vehicle’s handling capability. A fundamental challenge encountered in designing these software components lies in predicting the vehicle’s future state (e.g. position, orientation, and speed) with high accuracy. The root cause is the difficulty in identifying vehicle model parameters that capture the effects of lateral tire slip. We present a model-based planning and control framework for autonomous racing that significantly reduces the effort required in system identification and control design. Our approach alleviates the gap induced by simulation-based controller design by learning from on-board sensor measurements. A major focus of this work is empirical, thus, we demonstrate our contributions by experiments on validated 1:43 and 1:10 scale autonomous racing simulations.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Scaling model-based inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to real robotic manipulation tasks with unknown dynamics remains an open problem. The key challenges lie in learning good dynamics models, developing algorithms that scale to high-dimensional state-spaces and being able to learn from both visual and proprioceptive demonstrations. In this work, we present a gradient-based inverse reinforcement learning framework that utilizes a pre-trained visual dynamics model to learn cost functions when given only visual human demonstrations. The learned cost functions are then used to reproduce the demonstrated behavior via visual model predictive control. We evaluate our framework on hardware on two basic object manipulation tasks.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 104: PixL2R: Guiding Reinforcement Learning Using Natural Language by Mapping Pixels to Rewards
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in sparse reward settings, often requires prohibitively large numbers of interactions with the environment, thereby limiting its applicability to complex problems. To address this, several prior approaches have used natural language to guide the agent's exploration. However, these approaches typically operate on structured representations of the environment, and/or assume some structure in the natural language commands. In this work, we propose a model that directly maps pixels to rewards, given a free-form natural language description of the task, which can then be used for policy learning. Our experiments on the Meta-World robot manipulation domain show that  language-based rewards significantly improves the sample efficiency of policy learning, both in sparse and dense reward settings.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 101: Modeling Long-horizon Tasks as Sequential Interaction Landscapes
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Task planning over long-time horizons is a challenging and open problem in robotics and its complexity grows exponentially with an increasing number of subtasks. In this paper we present a deep neural network that learns dependencies and transitions across subtasks solely from a set of demonstration videos. We represent each subtasks as action symbols (e.g. move cup), and show that these symbols can be learned and predicted directly from image observations. Learning symbol sequences provides the network with additional information about the most frequent transitions and relevant dependencies between subtasks and thereby structures tasks over long-time horizons. Learning from images, on the other hand, allows the network to continuously monitor the task progress and thus to interactively adapt to changes in the environment. We evaluate our framework on two long horizon tasks: (1) block stacking of puzzle pieces being executed by humans, and (2) a robot manipulation task involving pick and place of objects and sliding a cabinet door with  a 7-DoF robot arm. We show that complex plans can be carried out when executing the robotic task and the robot can interactively adapt to changes in the environment and recover from failure cases.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 439: Deep Reactive Planning in Dynamic Environments
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  The main novelty of the proposed approach is that it allows a robot to learn an end-to-end policy which can adapt to changes in the environment during execution. While goal conditioning of policies has been studied in the RL literature, such approaches are not easily extended to settings where the robot's goal can change during execution. This is something that humans are naturally able to do. However, it is difficult for robots to learn such reflexes (i.e., to naturally respond to dynamic environments), especially when the goal location is not explicitly provided to the robot, and instead needs to be perceived through a vision sensor. In the current work, we present a method that can achieve such behavior by combining traditional kinematic planning, deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning in a synergistic fashion to generalize to arbitrary environments. We demonstrate the proposed approach for several reaching and pick-and-place tasks in simulation, as well as on a real system of a 6-DoF industrial manipulator.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Segmenting unseen objects in cluttered scenes is an important skill that robots need to acquire in order to perform tasks in new environments. In this work, we propose a new method for unseen object instance segmentation by learning RGB-D feature embeddings from synthetic data. A metric learning loss function is utilized to learn to produce pixel-wise feature embeddings such that pixels from the same object are close to each other and pixels from different objects are separated in the embedding space. With the learned feature embeddings, a mean shift clustering algorithm can be applied to discover and segment unseen objects. We further improve the segmentation accuracy with a new two-stage clustering algorithm. Our method demonstrates that non-photorealistic synthetic RGB and depth images can be used to learn feature embeddings that transfer well to real-world images for unseen object instance segmentation.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 96: S3K: Self-Supervised Semantic Keypoints for Robotic Manipulation via Multi-View Consistency
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  A robot’s ability to act is fundamentally constrained by what it can perceive. Many existing approaches to visual representation learning utilize general-purpose training criteria, e.g. image reconstruction, smoothness in latent space, or usefulness for control, or else make use of large datasets annotated with specific features (bounding boxes, segmentations, etc.). However, both approaches often struggle to capture the fine-detail required for precision tasks on specific objects, e.g. grasping and mating a plug and socket. We argue that these difficulties arise from a lack of geometric structure in these models. In this work we advocate semantic 3D keypoints as a visual representation, and present a semi-supervised training objective that can allow instance or category-level keypoints to be trained to 1-5 millimeter-accuracy with minimal supervision. Furthermore, unlike local texture-based approaches, our model integrates contextual information from a large area and is therefore robust to occlusion, noise, and lack of discernible texture. We demonstrate that this ability to locate semantic keypoints enables high level scripting of human understandable behaviours. Finally we show that these keypoints provide a good way to define reward functions for reinforcement learning and area good representation for training agents.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Motion planning in environments with multiple agents is critical to many important autonomous applications such as autonomous vehicles and assistive robots. This paper considers the problem of motion planning, where the controlled agent shares the environment with multiple uncontrolled agents. First, a predictive model of the uncontrolled agents is trained to predict all possible trajectories within a short horizon based on the scenario. The prediction is then fed to a motion planning module based on model predictive control. We proved generalization bound for the predictive model using three different methods, post-bloating, support vector machine (SVM), and conformal analysis, all capable of generating stochastic guarantees of the correctness of the predictor. The proposed approach is demonstrated in simulation in a scenario emulating autonomous highway driving.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Manipulating deformable objects has long been a challenge in robotics due to its high dimensional state representation and complex dynamics. Recent success in deep reinforcement learning provides a promising direction for learning to manipulate deformable objects with data driven methods. However, existing reinforcement learning benchmarks only cover tasks with direct state observability and simple low-dimensional dynamics or with relatively simple image-based environments, such as those with rigid objects. In this paper, we present SoftGym, a set of open-source simulated benchmarks for manipulating deformable objects, with a standard OpenAI Gym API and a Python interface for creating new environments. Our benchmark will enable reproducible research in this important area. Further, we evaluate a variety of algorithms on these tasks and highlight challenges for reinforcement learning algorithms, including dealing with a state representation that has a high intrinsic dimensionality and is partially observable. The experiments and analysis indicate the strengths and limitations of existing methods in the context of deformable object manipulation that can help point the way forward for future methods development.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 89: Recovering and Simulating Pedestrians in the Wild
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Sensor simulation is a key component for testing the performance of self-driving vehicles and for data augmentation to better train perception systems. Typical approaches rely on artists to create both 3D assets and their animations to generate a new scenario. This, however, does not scale. In contrast, we propose to recover the shape and motion of pedestrians from sensor readings captured in the wild by a self-driving car driving around. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem as energy minimization in a deep structured model that exploits human shape priors, reprojection consistency with 2D poses extracted from images, and a ray-caster that encourages the reconstructed mesh to agree with the LiDAR readings. Importantly, we do not require any ground-truth 3D scans or 3D pose annotations. We then incorporate the reconstructed pedestrian assets bank in a realistic LiDAR simulation system by performing motion retargeting, and show that the simulated LiDAR data can be used to significantly reduce the amount of annotated real-world data required for visual perception tasks.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 130: Motion Planner Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Robot Manipulation in Obstructed Environments
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents are able to learn contact-rich manipulation tasks by maximizing a reward signal, but require large amounts of experience, especially in environments with many obstacles that complicate exploration. In contrast, motion planners use explicit models of the agent and environment to plan collision-free paths to faraway goals, but suffer from inaccurate models in tasks that require contacts with the environment. To combine the benefits of both approaches, we propose motion planner augmented RL (MoPA-RL) which augments the action space of an RL agent with the long-horizon planning capabilities of motion planners. Based on the magnitude of the action, our approach smoothly transitions between directly executing the action and invoking a motion planner. We evaluate our approach on various simulated manipulation tasks and compare it to alternative action spaces in terms of learning efficiency and safety. The experiments demonstrate that MoPA-RL increases learning efficiency, leads to a faster exploration, and results in safer policies that avoid collisions with the environment.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Dexterous object manipulation is still an open problem in robotics, despite the rapid progress in machine learning during the past decade. We argue that a key issue which has hindered progress is the high cost of experimentation on real systems, in terms of both time and money. We address this problem by proposing a novel open-source robotic platform, consisting of hardware and software, to drastically reduce the cost of experimentation. The hardware is inexpensive yet highly dynamic, robust, and capable of complex contact interaction with external objects. The software allows for 1-kilohertz real-time control and performs safety checks to prevent the hardware from breaking. These properties enable the platform to run without human supervision. In addition, we provide easy-to-use C++ and Python interfaces. We illustrate the potential of the proposed platform by performing an object-manipulation task using an optimal-control algorithm and training a learning-based method directly on the real system.

title:  [CoRL 2020 Best Paper] Learning Latent Representations to Influence Multi-Agent Interaction
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Seamlessly interacting with humans or robots is hard because these agents are non-stationary. They update their policy in response to the ego agent's behavior, and the ego agent must anticipate these changes to co-adapt. Inspired by humans, we recognize that robots do not need to explicitly model every low-level action another agent will make; instead, we can capture the latent strategy of other agents through high-level representations. We propose a reinforcement learning-based framework for learning latent representations of an agent's policy, where the ego agent identifies the relationship between its behavior and the other agent's future strategy. The ego agent then leverages these latent dynamics to influence the other agent, purposely guiding them towards policies suitable for co-adaptation. Across several simulated domains and a real-world air hockey game, our approach outperforms the alternatives and learns to influence the other agent.

abstract:  Using visual model-based learning for deformable object manipulation is challenging due to difficulties in learning plannable visual representations along with complex dynamic models. In this work, we propose a new learning framework that jointly optimizes both the visual representation model and the dynamics model using contrastive estimation. Using simulation data collected by randomly perturbing deformable objects on a table, we learn latent dynamics models for these objects in an offline fashion. Then, using the learned models, we use simple model-based planning to solve challenging deformable object manipulation tasks such as spreading ropes and cloths. Experimentally, we show substantial improvements in performance over standard model-based learning techniques across our rope and cloth manipulation suite. Finally, we transfer our visual manipulation policies trained on data purely collected in simulation to a real PR2 robot through domain randomization.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 424: Learning to Improve Multi-Robot Hallway Navigation
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  As multi-robot applications become more prevalent, it becomes necessary to develop navigation systems which allow autonomous mobile robots to efficiently and safely pass each other in confined spaces. Existing navigation systems, such as the widely used ROS Navigation Stack, usually produce safe, collision free paths in static environments. However, these systems are not perfect, and when multiple mobile robots simultaneously navigate in narrow spaces, collisions and turnarounds are not uncommon. Fine-tuning and enhancing such navigation stacks is not as simple as it looks since they are made up of multiple layers of code, and there exists a tradeoff between optimizing for efficiency, i.e. minimizing time to destination (TTD) vs. optimizing for safety, i.e. minimizing collisions, with each objective leading to a different combination of parameter values. In this paper we develop a methodology to improve existing navigation stacks with regards to both objectives, without tuning their parameters, while preserving their inherent safety control properties. Our proposed approach is a decentralized learning-based approach that is geared toward real world robotic deployment, by requiring little computing resources. It is agnostic of the underlying navigation stack and can adapt to different types of environmental layouts (i.e., hallway structures).

abstract:  Accurately modeling robot dynamics is crucial to safe and efficient motion control. In this paper, we develop and apply an iterative learning semi-parametric model, with a neural network, to the task of autonomous racing with a Model Predictive  Controller (MPC). We present a novel non-linear semi-parametric dynamics model where we represent the known dynamics with a parametric model, and a neural network captures the unknown dynamics. We show that our model can learn more accurately than a purely parametric model and generalize better than a purely non-parametric model, making it ideal for real-world applications where collecting data from the full state space is not feasible. We present a system where the model is bootstrapped on pre-recorded data and then updated iteratively at run time. Then we apply our iterative learning approach to the simulated problem of autonomous racing and show that it can safely adapt to modified dynamics online and even achieve better performance than models trained on data from manual driving.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  To equip robots with dexterous skills, an effective approach is to first transfer the desired skill via Learning from Demonstration (LfD), then let the robot improve it by self-exploration via Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we propose a novel LfD+RL framework, namely Adaptive Conditional Neural Movement Primitives (ACNMP), that allows efficient policy improvement in novel environments and effective skill transfer between different agents. This is achieved through exploiting the latent representation learned by the underlying Conditional Neural Process (CNP) model, and simultaneous training of the model with supervised learning (SL) for acquiring the demonstrated trajectories and via RL for new trajectory discovery. Through simulation experiments, we show that (i) ACNMP enables the system to extrapolate to situations where pure LfD fails; (ii) Simultaneous training of the system through SL and RL  preserves the shape of demonstrations while adapting to novel situations due to the shared representations used by both learners; (iii) ACNMP enables order-of-magnitude sample-efficient RL in extrapolation of reaching tasks compared to the existing approaches; (iv) ACNMPs can be used to implement skill transfer between robots having different morphology, with competitive learning speeds and importantly with less number of assumptions compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we show the real-world suitability of ACNMPs through real robot experiments that involve obstacle avoidance, pick and place and pouring actions.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 108: Learning hierarchical relationships for object-goal navigation
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Direct search for objects as part of navigation poses a challenge for small items. Utilizing context in the form of object-object relationships enable hierarchical search for targets efficiently. Most of the current approaches tend to directly incorporate sensory input into a reward-based learning approach, without learning about object relationships in the natural environment, and thus generalize poorly across domains. We present Memory-utilized Joint hierarchical Object Learning for Navigation in Indoor Rooms (MJOLNIR), a target-driven navigation algorithm, which considers the inherent relationship between target objects, and the more salient contextual objects occurring in its surrounding. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple environment settings show an 82.9% and 93.5% gain over existing state-of-the-art navigation methods in terms of the success rate (SR), and success weighted by path length (SPL), respectively. We also show that our model learns to converge much faster than other algorithms, without suffering from the well-known overfitting problem.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 427: Unsupervised Monocular Depth Learning in Dynamic Scenes
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We present a method for jointly training the estimation of depth, ego-motion, and a dense 3D translation field of objects relative to the scene, with monocular photometric consistency being the sole source of supervision. We show that this apparently heavily underdetermined problem can be regularized by imposing the following prior knowledge about 3D translation fields: they are sparse, since most of the scene is static, and they tend to be piecewise constant for rigid moving objects. We show that this regularization alone is sufficient to train monocular depth prediction models that exceed the accuracy achieved in prior work for dynamic scenes, including methods that require semantic input.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 420: Deep Latent Competition: Learning to Race Using Visual Control Policies in Latent Space
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Learning competitive behaviors in multi-agent settings such as racing requires long-term reasoning about potential adversarial interactions. This paper presents Deep Latent Competition (DLC), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that learns competitive visual control policies through self-play in imagination. The DLC agent imagines multi-agent interaction sequences in the compact latent space of a learned world model that combines a joint transition function with opponent viewpoint prediction. Imagined self-play reduces costly sample generation in the real world, while the latent representation enables planning to scale gracefully with observation dimensionality.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in learning competitive behaviors on a novel multi-agent racing benchmark that requires planning from image observations.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 132: The EMPATHIC Framework for Task Learning from Implicit Human Feedback
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Reactions such as gestures, facial expressions, and vocalizations are an abundant, naturally occurring channel of information that humans provide during interactions. A robot or other agent could leverage an understanding of such implicit human feedback to improve its task performance at no cost to the human. This approach contrasts with common agent teaching methods based on demonstrations, critiques, or other guidance that need to be attentively and intentionally provided. In this paper, we first define the general problem of learning from implicit human feedback and then propose to address this problem through a novel data-driven framework, EMPATHIC. This two-stage method consists of (1) mapping implicit human feedback to relevant task statistics such as reward, optimality, and advantage; and (2) using such a mapping to learn a task. We instantiate the first stage and three second-stage evaluations of the learned mapping. To do so, we collect a dataset of human facial reactions while subjects observe an agent execute a sub-optimal policy for a prescribed training task. We train a deep neural network on this data and demonstrate its ability to (1) infer relative reward ranking of events in the training task from prerecorded human facial reactions; (2) improve the policy of an agent in the training task using live human facial reactions; and (3) transfer to a novel domain in which it evaluates robot manipulation trajectories.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 134: Range Conditioned Dilated Convolutions for Scale Invariant 3D Object Detection
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  This paper presents a novel 3D object detection framework that processes LiDAR data directly on its native representation: range images. Benefiting from the compactness of range images, 2D convolutions can efficiently process dense LiDAR data of the scene. To overcome scale sensitivity in this perspective view, a novel range-conditioned dilation (RCD) layer is proposed to dynamically adjust a continuous dilation rate as a function of the measured range. Furthermore, localized soft range gating combined with a 3D box-refinement stage improves robustness in occluded areas, and produces overall more accurate bounding box predictions. On the public large-scale Waymo Open Dataset, our method sets a new baseline for range-based 3D detection, outperforming multiview and voxel-based methods over all ranges with unparalleled performance at long range detection.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 417: Few-shot Object Grounding and Mapping for Natural Language Robot Instruction Following
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We study the problem of learning a robot policy to follow natural language instructions that can be easily extended to reason about new objects. We introduce a few-shot language-conditioned object grounding method trained from augmented reality data that uses exemplars to identify objects and align them to their mentions in instructions. We present a learned map representation that encodes object locations and their instructed use, and construct it from our few-shot grounding output. We integrate this mapping approach into an instruction-following policy, thereby allowing it to  reason about previously unseen objects at test-time by simply adding exemplars. We evaluate on the task of learning to map raw observations and instructions to continuous control of a physical quadcopter. Our approach significantly outperforms the prior state of the art in the presence of new objects, even when the prior approach observes all objects during training.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 135: High Acceleration Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Juggling with Binary Rewards
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Robots that can learn in the physical world will be important to enable robots to escape their stiff and pre-programmed movements.  For dynamic high-acceleration tasks, such as juggling, learning in the real-world is particularly challenging  as  one  must  push  the  limits  of  the  robot  and  its  actuation  without harming the system, amplifying the necessity of sample efficiency and safety for robot learning algorithms.  In contrast to prior work which mainly focuses on the learning algorithm, we propose a learning system, that directly incorporates these requirements in the design of the policy representation,  initialization,  and optimization.  We demonstrate that this system enables the high-speed Barrett WAM manipulator to learn juggling two balls from 56 minutes of experience with a binary reward signal and finally juggles continuously for up to 33 minutes or about 4500 repeated catches.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 416: Multiagent Rollout and Policy Iteration for POMDP with Application to Multi-Robot Repair Problems
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In this paper we consider infinite horizon discounted dynamic programming problems with finite state and control spaces, partial state observations, and a multiagent structure. We discuss and compare algorithms that simultaneously or sequentially optimize the agents' controls by using multistep lookahead, truncated rollout with a known base policy, and a terminal cost function approximation. Our methods specifically address the computational challenges of partially observable multiagent problems. In particular: 1) We consider rollout algorithms that dramatically reduce required computation while preserving the key cost improvement property of the standard rollout method. The per-step computational requirements for our methods are on the order of O(Cm) as compared with O(C^m) for standard rollout, where Cis the maximum cardinality of the constraint set for the control component of each agent, and m is the number of agents. 2) We show that our methods can be applied to challenging problems with a graph structure, including a class of robot repair problems whereby multiple robots collaboratively inspect and repair a system under partial information. 3) We provide a simulation study that compares our methods with existing methods, and demonstrate that our methods can handle larger and more complex partially observable multiagent problems (state space size 1E37 and control space size 1E7, respectively). In particular, we verify experimentally that our multiagent rollout methods perform nearly as well as standard rollout for problems with few agents, and produce satisfactory policies for problems with a larger number of agents that are intractable by standard rollout and other state of the art methods. Finally, we incorporate our multiagent rollout algorithms as building blocks in an approximate policy iteration scheme, where successive rollout policies are approximated by using neural network classifiers. While this scheme requires a strictly off-line implementation, it works well in our computational experiments and produces additional significant performance improvement over the single online rollout iteration method.

title:  [CoRL 2020 Best Paper Nominee] Guaranteeing Safety of Learned Perception Modules via Measurement-Robust Control Barrier Functions
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Modern nonlinear control theory seeks to develop feedback controllers that endow systems with properties such as safety and stability. The guarantees ensured by these controllers often rely on accurate estimates of the system state for determining control actions. In practice, measurement model uncertainty can lead to error in state estimates that degrades these guarantees. In this paper, we seek to unify techniques from control theory and machine learning to synthesize controllers that achieve safety in the presence of measurement model uncertainty. We define the notion of a Measurement-Robust Control Barrier Function (MR-CBF) as a tool for determining safe control inputs when facing measurement model uncertainty. Furthermore, MR-CBFs are used to inform sampling methodologies for learning-based perception systems and quantify tolerable error in the resulting learned models. We demonstrate the efficacy of MR-CBFs in achieving safety with measurement model uncertainty on a simulated Segway system.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 415: Diverse Plausible Shape Completions from Ambiguous Depth Images
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We propose PSSNet, a network architecture for generating diverse plausible 3D reconstructions from a single 2.5D depth image. Existing methods tend to produce only small variations on a single shape, even when multiple shapes are consistent with an observation. To obtain diversity we alter a Variational Auto Encoder by providing a learned shape bounding box feature as side information during training. Since these features are known during training, we are able to add a supervised loss to the encoder and noiseless values to the decoder. To evaluate, we sample a set of completions from a network, construct a set of plausible shape matches for each test observation, and compare using our plausible diversity metric defined over sets of shapes. We perform experiments using Shapenet mugs and partially-occluded YCB objects and find that our method performs comparably in datasets with little ambiguity, and outperforms existing methods when many shapes plausibly fit an observed depth image. We demonstrate one use for PSSNet on a physical robot when grasping objects in occlusion and clutter.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Imitation Learning techniques enable programming the behaviour of agents through demonstrations rather than manual engineering. However, they are limited by the quality of available demonstration data. Interactive Imitation Learning techniques can improve the efficacy of learning since they involve teachers providing feedback while the agent executes its task. In this work, we propose a novel Interactive Learning technique that uses human feedback in state-space to train and improve agent behaviour (as opposed to alternative methods that use feedback in action-space). Our method titled Teaching Imitative Policies in State-space (TIPS) enables providing guidance to the agent in terms of `changing its state' which is often more intuitive for a human demonstrator. Through continuous improvement via corrective feedback, agents trained by non-expert demonstrators using TIPS outperformed the demonstrator and conventional Imitation Learning agents.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We study the challenging problem of releasing a robot in a previously unseen environment, and having it follow unconstrained natural language navigation instructions. Recent work on the task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has achieved significant progress in simulation. To assess the implications of this work for robotics, we transfer a VLN agent trained in simulation to a physical robot. To bridge the gap between the high-level discrete action space learned by the VLN agent, and the robot’s low-level continuous action space, we propose a subgoal model to identify nearby waypoints, and use domain randomization to mitigate visual domain differences. For accurate sim and real comparisons in parallel environments, we annotate a 325m2 office space with 1.3km of navigation instructions, and create a digitized replica in simulation. We find that sim-to-real transfer to an environment not seen in training is successful if an occupancy map and navigation graph can be collected and annotated in advance (success rate of 46.8% vs. 55.9% in sim), but much more challenging in the hardest setting with no prior mapping at all (success rate of 22.5%).

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 166: Untangling Dense Knots by Learning Task-Relevant Keypoints
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Untangling ropes, wires, and cables is a challenging task for robots due to the high-dimensional configuration space, visual homogeneity, self-occlusions, and complex dynamics. We consider dense (tight) knots that lack space between self-intersections and present an iterative approach that uses learned geometric structure in configurations. We instantiate this into an algorithm, HULK: Hierarchical Untangling from Learned Keypoints, which combines learning-based perception with a geometric planner into a policy that guides a bilateral robot to untangle knots. To evaluate the policy, we perform experiments both in a novel simulation environment modelling cables with varied knot types and textures and in a physical system using the da Vinci surgical robot. We find that HULK is able to untangle cables with dense figure-eight and overhand knots and generalize to varied textures and appearances. We compare two variants of HULK to three baselines and observe that HULK achieves 43.3% higher success rates on a physical system compared to the next best baseline. HULK successfully untangles a cable from a dense initial configuration containing up to two overhand and figure-eight knots in 97.9% of 378 simulation experiments with an average of 12.1 actions per trial. In physical experiments, HULK achieves 61.7% untangling success, averaging 8.48 actions per trial.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 158: Assisted Perception: Optimizing Observations to Communicate State
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We aim to help users estimate the state of the world in tasks like robotic teleoperation and navigation with visual impairment, where user may have systematic biases that lead to suboptimal behavior: they might struggle to process observations from multiple sensors simultaneously, receive delayed observations, or underestimate distances to obstacles. While we cannot directly change the user's internal beliefs or their internal state estimation process, our insight is that we can still assist them by modifying the user's observations. Instead of showing the user their true observations, ***we synthesize new observations that lead to more accurate internal state estimates when processed by the user***. We refer to this method as assistive state estimation (ASE): an automated assistant uses the true observations to infer the state of the world, then generates a modified observation for the user to consume (e.g., through an augmented reality interface), and optimizes the modification to induce the user's new beliefs to match the assistant's current beliefs. To predict the effect of the modified observation on the user's beliefs, ASE learns a model of the user's state estimation process: after each task completion, it searches for a model that would have led to beliefs that explain the user's actions. We evaluate ASE in a user study with 12 participants who each perform four tasks: two tasks with known user biases - bandwidth-limited image classification and a driving video game with observation delay - and two with unknown biases that our method has to learn - guided 2D navigation and a lunar lander teleoperation video game. ASE's general-purpose approach to synthesizing informative observations enables a different assistance strategy to emerge in each domain, such as quickly revealing informative pixels to speed up image classification, using a dynamics model to undo observation delay in driving, identifying nearby landmarks for navigation, and exaggerating a visual indicator of tilt in the lander game. The results show that ASE substantially improves the task performance of users with bandwidth constraints, observation delay, and other unknown biases.

Furthermore, to make our VO model generalize across datasets, we propose an up-to-scale loss function and incorporate the camera intrinsic parameters into the model. Experiments show that a single model, TartanVO, trained only on synthetic data, without any finetuning, can be generalized to real-world datasets such as KITTI and EuRoC, demonstrating significant advantages over the geometry-based methods on challenging trajectories.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We propose a data-driven method to automatically generate feedback controllers for soft multicopters featuring deformable materials, non-conventional geometries, and asymmetric rotor layouts, to deliver compliant deformation and agile locomotion. Our approach coordinates two sub-systems: a physics-inspired network ensemble that simulates the soft drone dynamics and a custom LQR control loop enhanced by a novel online-relinearization scheme to control the neural dynamics. Harnessing the insights from deformation mechanics, we design a decomposed state formulation whose modularity and compactness facilitate the dynamics learning while its measurability readies it for real-world adaptation. Our method is painless to implement, and requires only conventional, low-cost gadgets for fabrication. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by controlling a variety of customized soft multicopters to perform hovering, target reaching, velocity tracking, and active deformation.

title:  [CoRL 2020 Best Paper Presentation Nominee] Transporter Networks: Rearranging the Visual World for Robotic Manipulation
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Robotic manipulation can be formulated as inducing a sequence of spatial displacements: where the space being moved can encompass an object, part of an object, or end effector. In this work, we propose the Transporter Network, a simple model architecture that rearranges deep features to infer spatial displacements from visual input - which can parameterize robot actions. It makes no assumptions of objectness (e.g. canonical poses, models, or keypoints), it exploits spatial symmetries, and is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than our benchmarked alternatives in learning vision-based manipulation tasks: from stacking a pyramid of blocks, to assembling kits with unseen objects; from manipulating deformable ropes, to pushing piles of small objects with closed-loop feedback. Our method can represent complex multi-modal policy distributions and generalizes to multi-step sequential tasks, as well as 6DoF pick-and-place. Experiments on 10 simulated tasks show that it learns faster and generalizes better than a variety of end-to-end baselines, including policies that use ground-truth object poses. We validate our methods with hardware in the real world.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 151: Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Multiagent Rendezvous
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Collaboration requires agents to align their goals on the fly. Underlying the human ability to align goals with other agents is their ability to predict the intentions of others and actively update their own plans. We propose hierarchical predictive planning (HPP), a model-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized multiagent rendezvous. Starting with pretrained, single-agent point to point navigation policies  and using noisy, high-dimensional sensor inputs like lidar, we first learn via self-supervision motion predictions of all agents on the team. Next, HPP uses the prediction models to propose and evaluate navigation subgoals for completing the rendezvous task without explicit communication among agents. We evaluate HPP in a suite of unseen environments, with increasing complexity and numbers of obstacles. We show that HPP outperforms alternative reinforcement learning, path planning, and heuristic-based baselines on challenging, unseen environments. Experiments in the real world demonstrate successful transfer of the prediction models from sim to real world without any additional fine-tuning. Altogether, HPP removes the need for a centralized operator in multiagent systems by combining model-based RL and inference methods, enabling agents to dynamically align plans.

title:  [CoRL 2020 Best Paper Nominee] Safe Optimal Control Using Stochastic Barrier Functions and Deep Forward-Backward SDEs
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  This paper introduces a new formulation for stochastic optimal control and stochastic  dynamic  optimization that ensures safety with respect to state and control constraints.  The proposed  methodology brings together concepts such as  Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations,  Stochastic  Barrier Functions, Differentiable Convex Optimization and Deep Learning.  Using the aforementioned concepts, a Neural Network architecture is designed for safe trajectory optimization in which learning can be performed in  an end-to-end fashion. Simulations are performed on three systems to show the efficacy of the proposed methodology.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 149: Keypoints into the Future: Self-Supervised Correspondence in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Predictive models have been at the core of many robotic systems, from quadrotors to walking robots. However, it has been challenging to develop and apply such models to practical robotic manipulation due to high-dimensional sensory observations such as images. Previous approaches to learning models in the context of robotic manipulation have either learned whole image dynamics or used autoencoders to learn dynamics in a low-dimensional latent state. In this work, we introduce model-based prediction with self-supervised visual correspondence learning, and show that not only is this indeed possible, but demonstrate that these types of predictive models show compelling performance improvements over alternative methods for vision-based RL with autoencoder-type vision training. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our models provide better generalization precision, particularly in 3D scenes, scenes involving occlusion, and in category-generalization. Additionally, we validate that our method effectively transfers to the real world through hardware experiments.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 392: MultiPoint: Cross-spectral registration of thermal and optical aerial imagery
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  While optical cameras are ubiquitous in robotics, some robots can sense the world in several sections of the electromagnetic spectrum simultaneously, which can extend their capabilities in fundamental ways. For instance, many fixed-wing UAVs carry both optical and thermal imaging cameras, potentially allowing them to detect temperature difference-induced atmospheric updrafts, map their locations, and adjust their flight path accordingly to increase their time aloft. A key step for unlocking the potential offered by multi-spectral data is generating consistent, multi-spectral maps of the environment. In this work, we introduce MultiPoint, a novel data-driven method for generating interest points and associated descriptors for registering optical and thermal image pairs without knowledge of the relative camera viewpoints. Existing pixel-based alignment methods are accurate but too slow to work in near-real time, while feature-based methods such as SuperPoint are fast but produce poor-quality cross-spectral matches due to interest point instability in thermal images. MultiPoint capitalizes on the strengths of both approaches.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 381: Learning Object-conditioned Exploration using Distributed Soft Actor Critic
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Object navigation is defined as navigating to an object of a given label in a complex, unexplored environment. In its general form, this problem poses several challenges for Robotics: semantic exploration of unknown environments in search of an object and low-level control. In this work we study object-guided exploration and low-level control, and present an end-to-end trained navigation policy achieving a success rate of 0.68 and SPL of 0.58 on unseen, visually complex scans of real homes. We propose a highly scalable implementation of an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, distributed Soft Actor Critic, which allows the system to utilize 98M experience steps in 24 hours on 8 GPUs. Our system learns to control a differential drive mobile base in simulation from a stack of high dimensional observations commonly used on robotic platforms. The learned policy is capable of object-guided exploratory behaviors and low-level control learned from pure experiences in realistic environments.

abstract:  Predicting the future behavior of moving agents is essential for real world applications. It is challenging as the intent of the agent and the corresponding behavior is unknown and intrinsically multimodal. Our key insight is that for prediction within a moderate time horizon, the future modes can be effectively captured by a set of target states. This leads to our target-driven trajectory prediction (TNT) framework. TNT has three stages which are trained end-to-end. It

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 496: Harnessing Distribution Ratio Estimators for Learning Agents with Quality and Diversity
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Quality-Diversity (QD) is a concept from Neuroevolution with some intriguing applications to Reinforcement Learning. It facilitates learning a population of agents where each member is optimized to simultaneously accumulate high task-returns and exhibit behavioral diversity compared to other members. In this paper, we build on a recent kernel-based method for training a QD policy ensemble with Stein variational gradient descent. With kernels based on f-divergence between the stationary distributions of policies, we convert the problem to that of efficient estimation of the ratio of these stationary distributions. We then study various distribution ratio estimators used previously for off-policy evaluation and imitation and re-purpose them to compute the gradients for policies in an ensemble such that the resultant population is diverse and of high-quality.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 374: 3D-OES: Viewpoint-Invariant Object-Factorized Environment Simulators
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We propose an action-conditioned dynamics model that predicts scene changes caused by object and agent interactions in a viewpoint-invariant 3D neural scene representation space, inferred from RGB-D videos. In this 3D feature space, objects do not interfere with one another and their appearance persists over time and across viewpoints. This permits our model to predict future scenes long in the future by simply “moving” 3D object features based on cumulative object motion predictions.  Object motion predictions are computed by a graph neural network that operates over the object features extracted from the 3D neural scene representation. Our model’s simulations can be decoded by a neural renderer into 2D image views from any desired viewpoint, which aids the interpretability of our latent 3D simulation space.  We show our model generalizes well its predictions across varying number and appearances of interacting objects as well as across camera viewpoints, outperforming existing 2D and 3D dynamics models. We further demonstrate sim-to-real transfer of the learnt dynamics by applying our model trained solely in simulation to model-based control for pushing objects to desired locations under clutter on a real robotic setup.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 176: Learning to Compose Hierarchical Object-Centric Controllers for Robotic Manipulation
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Manipulation tasks can often be decomposed into multiple subtasks performed in parallel, e.g., sliding an object to a goal pose while maintaining contact with a table.  Individual subtasks can be achieved by task-axis controllers defined relative to the objects being manipulated, and a set of object-centric controllers can be combined in an hierarchy. In prior works, such combinations are defined manually or learned from demonstrations. By contrast, we propose using reinforcement learning to dynamically compose hierarchical object-centric controllers for manipulation tasks. Experiments in both simulation and real world show how the proposed approach leads to improved sample efficiency, zero-shot generalization to novel test environments, and simulation-to-reality transfer without fine-tuning.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 4: Learning a Decision Module by Imitating Driver’s Control Behaviors
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Autonomous driving systems have a pipeline of perception, decision, planning, and control. The decision module processes information from the perception module and directs the execution of downstream planning and control modules. On the other hand, the recent success of deep learning suggests that this pipeline could be replaced by end-to-end neural control policies, however, safety cannot be well guaranteed for the data-driven neural networks. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework to learn neural decisions in the classical modular pipeline through end-to-end imitation learning.  This hybrid framework can preserve the merits of the classical pipeline such as the strict enforcement of physical and logical constraints while learning complex driving decisions from data. To circumvent the ambiguous annotation of human driving decisions, our method learns high-level driving decisions by imitating low-level control behaviors. We show in the simulation experiments that our modular driving agent can generalize its driving decision and control to various complex scenarios where the rule-based programs fail. It can also generate smoother and safer driving trajectories than end-to-end neural policies.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 359: Volumetric Grasping Network: Real-time 6 DOF Grasp Detection in Clutter
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  General robot grasping in clutter requires the ability to synthesize grasps that work for previously unseen objects and that are also robust to physical interactions, such as collisions with other objects in the scene. In this work, we design and train a network that predicts 6 DOF grasps from 3D scene information gathered from an on-board sensor such as a wrist-mounted depth camera. Our proposed Volumetric Grasping Network (VGN) accepts a Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) representation of the scene and directly outputs the predicted grasp quality and the associated gripper orientation and opening width for each voxel in the queried 3D volume. We show that our approach can plan grasps in only 10 ms and is able to clear 92% of the objects in real-world clutter removal experiments without the need for explicit collision checking. The real-time capability opens up the possibility for closed-loop grasp planning, allowing robots to handle disturbances, recover from errors and provide increased robustness.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We present a hierarchical framework that combines model-based control and reinforcement learning (RL) to synthesize robust controllers for a quadruped (the Unitree Laikago). The system consists of a high-level controller that learns to choose from a set of primitives in response to changes in the environment and a low-level controller that utilizes an established control method to robustly execute the primitives. Our framework learns a controller that can adapt to challenging environmental changes on the fly, including novel scenarios not seen during training. The learned controller is up to 85~percent more energy efficient and is more robust compared to baseline methods. We also deploy the controller on a physical robot without any randomization or adaptation scheme.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 348: Same Object, Different Grasps: Data and Semantic Knowledge for Task-Oriented Grasping
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Despite the enormous progress and generalization in robotic grasping in recent years, existing methods have yet to scale and generalize task-oriented grasping to the same extent. This is largely due to the scale of the datasets both in terms of the number of objects and tasks studied. We address these concerns with the TaskGrasp dataset which is more diverse both in terms of objects and tasks, and an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets. The dataset contains 250K task-oriented grasps for 56 tasks and 191 objects along with their RGB-D information. We take advantage of this new breadth and diversity in the data and present the GCNGrasp framework which uses the semantic knowledge of objects and tasks encoded in a knowledge graph to generalize to new object instances, classes and even new tasks. Our framework shows a significant improvement of around 12% on held-out settings compared to baseline methods which do not use semantics. We demonstrate that our dataset and model are applicable for the real world by executing task-oriented grasps on a real robot on unknown objects.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 293: Learning Hybrid Control Barrier Functions from Data
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Motivated by the lack of systematic tools to obtain safe control laws for hybrid systems, we propose an optimization-based framework for learning certifiably safe control laws from data. In particular, we assume a setting in which the system dynamics are known and in which data exhibiting safe system behavior is available. We propose hybrid control barrier functions for hybrid systems as a means to synthesize safe control inputs. Based on this notion, we present an optimization-based framework to learn such hybrid control barrier functions from data. Importantly, we identify sufficient conditions on the data such that feasibility of the optimization problem ensures correctness of the learned hybrid control barrier functions, and hence the safety of the system. We illustrate our findings in two simulations studies, including a compass gait walker.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In this paper, we solve the problem of finding a certified control policy that drives a robot from any given initial state and under any bounded disturbance to the desired reference trajectory, with guarantees on the convergence or bounds on the tracking error. Such a controller is crucial in safe motion planning. We leverage the advanced theory in Control Contraction Metric and design a learning framework based on neural networks to co-synthesize the contraction metric and the controller for control-affine systems. We further provide methods to validate the convergence and bounded error guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of our method using a suite of challenging robotic models, including models with learned dynamics as neural networks. We compare our approach with leading methods using sum-of-squares programming, reinforcement learning, and model predictive control. Results show that our methods indeed can handle a broader class of systems with less tracking error and faster execution speed.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Autonomous robot systems for applications from search and rescue to assistive guidance should be able to engage in natural language dialog with people. To study such cooperative communication, we introduce Robot Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with Natural Language (RobotSlang), a benchmark of 169 natural language dialogs between a human Driver controlling a robot and a human Commander providing guidance towards navigation goals. In each trial, the pair first cooperates to localize the robot on a global map visible to the Commander, then the Driver follows Commander instructions to move the robot to a sequence of target objects. We introduce a Localization from Dialog History (LDH) and a Navigation from Dialog History (NDH) task where a learned agent is given dialog and visual observations from the robot platform as input and must localize in the global map or navigate towards the next target object, respectively. RobotSlang is comprised of nearly 5k utterances and over 1k minutes of robot camera and control streams. We present an initial model for the NDH task, and show that an agent trained in simulation can follow the RobotSlang dialog-based navigation instructions for controlling a physical robot platform.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 340: Policy learning in SE(3) action spaces
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In the spatial action representation, the action space spans the space of target poses for robot motion commands, i.e. SE(2) or SE(3). This approach has been used to solve challenging robotic manipulation problems and shows promise. However, the method is often limited to a three dimensional action space and short horizon tasks. This paper proposes ASRSE3, a new method for handling higher dimensional spatial action spaces that transforms an original MDP with high dimensional action space into a new MDP with reduced action space and augmented state space. We also propose SDQfD, a variation of DQfD designed for large action spaces. ASRSE3 and SDQfD are evaluated in the context of a set of challenging block construction tasks. We show that both methods outperform standard baselines and can be used in practice on real robotics systems.

This leads to inefficient goal sampling and ineffective reward functions. In this paper, we improve upon previous visual self-supervised RL by incorporating object-level reasoning and occlusion reasoning. Specifically, we use unknown object segmentation to ignore distractors in the scene for better reward computation and goal generation; we further enable occlusion reasoning by employing a novel auxiliary loss and training scheme. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm, ROLL (Reinforcement learning with Object Level Learning), learns dramatically faster and achieves better final performance compared with previous methods in several simulated visual control tasks.

title:  [CoRL 2020 Best Paper Presentation Nominee] Universal Embeddings for Spatio-Temporal Tagging of Self-Driving Logs
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In this paper, we tackle the problem of spatio-temporal tagging of self-driving scenes from raw sensor data. Our approach learns a universal embedding for all tags, enabling efficient tagging of many attributes and faster learning of new attributes with limited data. Importantly, the embedding is spatio-temporally aware, allowing the model to naturally output spatio-temporal tag values. Values can then be pooled over arbitrary regions, in order to, for example, compute the pedestrian density in front of the SDV, or determine if a car is blocking another car at a 4-way intersection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a new large scale self-driving dataset, SDVScenes, containing 15 attributes relating to vehicle and pedestrian density, the actions of each actor, the speed of each actor, interactions between actors, and the topology of the road map.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 346: Learning an Expert Skill-Space for Replanning Dynamic Quadruped Locomotion over Obstacles
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Function approximators are increasingly being considered as a tool for generating robot motions that are temporally extended and express foresight about the scenario at hand. While these longer behaviors are often necessary or beneficial, they also induce multimodality in the decision space, which complicates the training of a regression model on expert data. Motivated by the problem of quadrupedal locomotion over obstacles, we apply an approach that disentangles modal variation from task-to-solution regression by using a conditional variational autoencoder. The resulting decoder is a regression model that outputs trajectories based on the task and a real-valued latent mode vector representing a style of behavior. With the task consisting of robot-relative descriptions of the state, the goal, and nearby obstacles, this model is suitable for receding-horizon generation of structured dynamic motion. We test this approach, along with a trajectory library baseline method, for producing sustained locomotion plans that use a generalized gait. Both options strongly bias planned footholds away from obstacle regions, while the multimodal regressor is far less susceptible to violating kinematic constraints. We conclude by identifying further prospective benefits of the continuous latent mode representation, along with targets for future integration into a hardware-deployable pipeline including perception and control.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  This paper presents a novel framework for planning paths in maps containing unknown spaces, such as from occlusions. Our approach takes as input a semantically-annotated point cloud, and leverages an image inpainting neural network to generate a reasonable model of unknown space as free or occupied. Our validation campaign shows that it is possible to greatly increase the performance of standard pathfinding algorithms which adopt the general optimistic assumption of treating unknown space as free.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 282:  Stein Variational Model Predictive Control
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Decision making under uncertainty is critical to real-world, autonomous systems. Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods have demonstrated favorable performance in practice, but remain limited when dealing with complex probability distributions. In this paper, we propose a generalization of MPC that represents a multitude of solutions as posterior distributions. By casting MPC as a Bayesian inference problem, we employ variational methods for posterior computation, naturally encoding the complexity and multi-modality of the decision making problem. We propose a Stein variational gradient descent method to estimate the posterior directly over control parameters, given a cost function and observed state trajectories. We show that this framework leads to successful planning in challenging, non-convex optimal control problems.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 221: Towards General and Autonomous Learning of Core Skills: A Case Study in Locomotion
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms promise to solve difficult motor control problems directly from raw sensory inputs. Their attraction is due in part to the fact that they can represent a general class of methods that allow to learn a solution with a reasonably set reward and minimal prior knowledge, even in situations where it is difficult or expensive for a human expert. For RL to truly make good on this promise, however, we need algorithms and learning setups that can work across a broad range of problems with minimal problem specific adjustments or engineering. In this paper, we study this idea of generality in the locomotion domain. We develop a learning framework that can learn sophisticated locomotion behaviour for a wide spectrum of legged robots, such as bipeds, tripeds, quadrupeds and hexapods, including wheeled variants.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 283: Learning Interactively to Resolve Ambiguity in Reference Frame Selection
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  In Learning from Demonstrations, ambiguities can lead to bad generalization of the learned policy. This paper proposes a framework called Learning Interactively to Resolve Ambiguity (LIRA), that recognizes ambiguous situations, in which more than one action have similar probabilities, avoids a random action selection, and uses the human feedback for solving them. The aim is to improve the user experience, the learning performance and safety. LIRA is tested in the selection of the right goal of Movement Primitives (MP) out of a candidate list if multiple contradictory generalizations of the demonstration(s) are possible. The framework is validated on different pick and place operations on a Emika-Franka Robot. A user study showed a significant reduction on the task load of the user, compared to a system that does not allow interactive resolution of ambiguities.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 345: Amodal 3D Reconstruction for Robotic Manipulation via Stability and Connectivity
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Learning-based 3D object reconstruction enables single- or few-shot estimation of 3D object models. For robotics,  this holds the potential to allow model-based methods to rapidly adapt to novel objects and scenes. Existing 3D reconstruction techniques optimize for visual reconstruction fidelity, typically measured by chamfer distance or voxel IOU. We find that when applied to realistic, cluttered robotics environments, these systems produce reconstructions with low physical realism, resulting in poor task performance when used for model-based control.  We propose ARM, an amodal 3D reconstruction system that introduces (1) a stability prior over object shapes, (2) a connectivity prior, and (3) a multi-channel input representation that allows for reasoning over relationships between groups of objects.  By using these priors over the physical properties of objects, our system improves reconstruction quality not just by standard visual metrics, but also performance of model-based control on a variety of robotics manipulation tasks in challenging, cluttered environments.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 465: Self-Supervised Learning of Scene-Graph Representations for Robotic Sequential Manipulation Planning
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  We present a self-supervised representation learning approach for visual reasoning and integrate it into a nonlinear program formulation for motion optimization to tackle sequential manipulation tasks. Such problems have usually been addressed by combined task and motion planning approaches, for which spatial relations and logical rules that rely on symbolic representations have to be predefined by the user. We propose to learn relational structures by leveraging visual perception to alleviate the resulting knowledge acquisition bottleneck. In particular, we learn constructing scene-graphs, that represent objects (""red box""), and their spatial relationships (""yellow cylinder on red box""). This representation allows us to plan high-level discrete decisions effectively using graph search algorithms. We integrate the visual reasoning module with a nonlinear optimization method for robot motion planning and verify its feasibility on the classic blocks-world domain. Our proposed framework successfully finds the sequence of actions and enables the robot to execute feasible motion plans to realize the given tasks.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 203: Contrastive Variational Reinforcement Learning for Complex Observation
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved significant success in various robot tasks: manipulation, navigation, etc. However, complex visual observations in natural environments remains a major challenge. This paper presents Contrastive Variational Reinforcement Learning (CVRL), a model-based method that tackles complex visual observations in  DRL.  CVRL learns a contrastive variational model by maximizing the mutual information between latent states and observations discriminatively, through contrastive learning. It avoids modeling the complex observation space unnecessarily, as the commonly used generative observation model often does,  and is significantly more robust. CVRL achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art model-based DRL methods on standard Mujoco tasks. It significantly outperforms them on Natural Mujoco tasks and a robot box-pushing task with complex observations, e.g., dynamic shadows.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 250: Flightmare: A Flexible Quadrotor Simulator
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  State-of-the-art quadrotor simulators have a rigid and highly-specialized structure: either are they really fast, physically accurate, or photo-realistic. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the development of simulators: moving the trade-off between accuracy and speed from the developers to the end-users. We use this idea to develop a flexible quadrotor simulator: Flightmare. In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor simulator: Flightmare.  Flightmare is composed of two main components: a configurable rendering engine built on Unity and a flexible physics engine for dynamics simulation. Those two components are totally decoupled and can run independently of each other. This makes our simulator extremely fast: rendering achieves speeds of up to 230 Hz, while physics simulation of up to 200,000 Hz on a laptop. In addition, Flightmare comes with several desirable features: (i) a large multi-modal sensor suite, including an interface to extract the 3D point-cloud of the scene; (ii) an API for reinforcement learning which can simulate hundreds of quadrotors in parallel; and (iii) integration with a virtual-reality headset for interaction with the simulated environment. We demonstrate the flexibility of Flightmare by using it for two different robotic tasks: quadrotor control using deep reinforcement learning and collision-free path planning in a complex 3D environment.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 368: Time-Bounded Mission Planning in Time-Varying Domains with Semi-MDPs and Gaussian Processes
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Uncertain, time-varying dynamic environments are ubiquitous in real world robotics. We propose an online planning framework to address time-bounded missions under time-varying dynamics, where those dynamics affect the duration and outcome of actions. We pose such problems as semi-Markov decision processes, where actions have a duration distributed according to an a priori unknown time-varying function. Our approach maintains a belief over this function, and time is propagated through a discrete search tree that efficiently maintains a subset of reachable states. We show improved mission performance on a marine vehicle simulator acting under real-world spatio-temporal ocean currents, and demonstrate the ability to solve co-safe linear temporal logic problems, which are more complex than the reachability problems tackled in previous approaches.

abstract:  Reliable and stable locomotion has been one of the most fundamental challenges for legged robots. Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has emerged as a promising method for developing such control policies autonomously. In this paper, we develop a system for learning legged locomotion policies with deep RL in the real world with minimal human effort. The key difficulties for on-robot learning systems are automatic data collection and safety. We overcome these two challenges by developing a multi-task learning procedure and a safety-constrained RL framework. We tested our system on the task of learning to walk on three different terrains: flat ground, a soft mattress, and a doormat with crevices. Our system can automatically and efficiently learn locomotion skills on a Minitaur robot with little human intervention.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 263: StrObe: Streaming Object Detection from LiDAR Packets
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Many modern robotics systems employ LiDAR as their main sensing modality due to its geometrical richness. Rolling shutter LIDARs are particularly common, in which a sweep is built through the accumulation of points over an entire revolution of the sensor, thus producing a 360 point cloud of the scene. Modern perception algorithms wait for the full sweep to be built before processing the data, which introduces an additional latency of up to 100ms. As a consequence, by the time an output is produced, it no longer accurately reflects the state of the world. This poses a big challenge, as robotics applications require minimal reaction times, such that maneuvers can be quickly planned in the event of a safety-critical situation. In this paper we propose StrObe, a novel approach that minimizes latency by ingesting packets of LiDAR and emitting a stream of detections without waiting for the full sweep to be built. StrObe reuses computations from previous points and iteratively updates the spatial memory of the scene as new evidence comes in, resulting in latency reduced accurate perception. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large scale dataset, showing that our approach far outperforms the state-of-the-art when latency is taken into account while still matching the performance in the traditional setting.

First, we create an object-agnostic map from real tactile observations to contact shapes. Next, for a new object with known geometry, we learn a tailored perception model completely in simulation. To do so, we simulate the contact shapes that a dense set of object poses would produce on the sensor. Then, given a new contact shape obtained from the sensor output, we match it against the pre-computed set using the object-specific embedding learned purely in simulation using contrastive learning.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  To achieve high-levels of autonomy, modern robots require the ability to detect and recover from anomalies and failures with minimal human supervision. Multi-modal sensor signals could provide more information for such anomaly detection tasks; however, the fusion of high-dimensional and heterogeneous sensor modalities remains a challenging problem. We propose a deep learning neural network: supervised variational autoencoder (SVAE), for failure identification in unstructured and uncertain environments. Our model leverages the representational power of VAE to extract robust features from high-dimensional inputs for supervised learning tasks. The training objective unifies the generative model and the discriminative model, thus making the learning a one-stage procedure. Our experiments on real field robot data demonstrate superior failure identification performance than baseline methods, and that our model learns interpretable representations.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 364: Belief-Grounded Networks for Accelerated Robot Learning under Partial Observability
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Many important robotics problems are partially observable where a single visual or force-feedback measurement is insufficient to reconstruct the state. Standard approaches involve learning a policy over beliefs or observation-action histories.    However, both of these have drawbacks; it is expensive to track the belief online, and it is hard to learn policies directly over histories. We propose a method for policy learning under partial observability called the Belief-Grounded Network (BGN) in which an auxiliary belief-reconstruction loss incentivizes a neural network to concisely summarize its input history. Since the resulting policy is a function of the history rather than the belief, it can be executed easily at runtime. We compare BGN against several baselines on classic benchmark tasks as well as three novel robotic force-feedback tasks. BGN outperforms all other tested methods and its learned policies work well when transferred onto a physical robot.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great success in learning complex control policies for a variety of applications in robotics. However, in most such cases, the hardware of the robot has been considered immutable, modeled as part of the environment.  In this study, we explore the problem of learning hardware and control parameters together in a unified RL framework. To achieve this, we propose to model the robot body as a “hardware policy”, analogous to and optimized jointly with its computational counterpart. We show that, by modeling such hardware policies as auto-differentiable computational graphs, the ensuing optimization problem can be solved efficiently by gradient-based algorithms from the Policy Optimization family.  We present two such design examples:  a toy mass-spring problem, and a real-world problem of designing an underactuated hand.  We compare our method against traditional co-optimization approaches, and also demonstrate its effectiveness by building a physical prototype based on the learned hardware parameters.

authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Recent learning-based LiDAR odometry methods have demonstrated their competitiveness. However, most methods still face two substantial challenges: 1) the 2D projection representation of LiDAR data cannot effectively encode 3D structures from the point clouds; 2) the needs for a large amount of labeled data for training limit the application scope of these methods. In this paper, we propose an self-supervised LiDAR odometry method, dubbed SelfVoxeLO, to tackle these two difficulties. Specifically, we propose a 3D convolution network to process the raw LiDAR data directly, which extracts features that better encode the 3D geometric patterns. To suit our network to self-supervised learning, we design several novel loss functions that utilize the inherent properties of LiDAR point clouds. Moreover, an uncertainty-aware mechanism is incorporated in the loss functions to alleviate the interference of moving objects/noises. We evaluate our method's performances on two large-scale datasets, i.e., KITTI and Apollo-SouthBay.Our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by 27%/32% in terms of translational/rotational errors on the KITTI dataset and also performs well on the Apollo-SouthBay dataset. By including more unlabelled training data, our method can further improve performance comparable to the supervised methods.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 211: robably Approximately Correct Vision-Based Planning using Motion Primitives
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  This paper presents an approach for learning vision-based planners that provably generalize to novel environments (i.e., environments unseen during training). We leverage the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes framework to obtain an upper bound on the expected cost of policies across all environments. Minimizing the PAC-Bayes upper bound thus trains policies that are accompanied by a certificate of performance on novel environments. The training pipeline we propose provides strong generalization guarantees for deep neural network policies by (a) obtaining a good prior distribution on the space of policies using Evolutionary Strategies (ES) followed by (b) formulating the PAC-Bayes optimization as an efficiently-solvable parametric convex optimization problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for producing strong generalization guarantees for learned vision-based motion planners through two simulated examples: (1) an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigating obstacle fields with an onboard vision sensor, and (2) a dynamic quadrupedal robot traversing rough terrains with proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors.

title:  CoRL 2020, Spotlight Talk 286: A User’s Guide to Calibrating Robotic Simulators
authors:  Conference on Robot Learning
abstract:  Simulators are a critical component of modern robotics research. Strategies for both perception and decision making can be studied in simulation first, before deployed to real world systems, saving on time and costs. Despite significant progress on the development of sim-to-real algorithms, the analysis of  different methods is still conducted in an ad-hoc manner without a consistent set of tests and metrics for comparison. This paper intends to fill this gap and proposes a set of benchmarks and a framework for the study of various algorithms aimed to transfer models and policies learnt in simulation to the real world. We conduct experiments on a wide range of well known simulated environments to characterise and offer insights into the performance of different algorithms. Our analysis can be useful for practitioners working in this area and can help make informed choices about the behaviour and main properties of sim-to-real algorithms.

title:  Examining the Ordering of Rhetorical Strategies in Persuasive Requests
authors:  Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech
abstract:  Interpreting how persuasive language influences audiences has implications across many domains like advertising, argumentation, and propaganda. Persuasion relies on more than a message’s content. Arranging the order of the message itself (i.e., ordering specific rhetorical strategies) also plays an important role. To examine how strategy orderings contribute to persuasiveness, we first utilize a Variational Autoencoder model to disentangle content and rhetorical strategies in textual requests from a

title:  Local Additivity Based Data Augmentation for Semi-supervised NER - A EMNLP 2020 Paper
authors:  Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech
abstract:  Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the first stages in deep language understanding yet current NER models heavily rely on human-annotated data. In this work, to alleviate the dependence on labeled data, we propose a Local Additivity based Data Augmentation (LADA) method for semi-supervised NER, in which we create virtual samples by interpolating sequences close to each other. Our approach has two variations: Intra-LADA and InterLADA, where Intra-LADA performs interpolations among tokens within one sentence, and Inter-LADA samples different sentences to interpolate. Through linear additions between sampled training data, LADA creates an infinite amount of labeled data and improves both entity and context learning. We further extend LADA to the semi-supervised setting by designing a novel consistency loss for unlabeled data. Experiments conducted on two NER benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods over several strong baselines. We have publicly released our code at https://github.com/GT-SALT/LADA.

title:  Will It Unblend? An EMNLP 2020 Paper
authors:  Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech
abstract:  Natural language processing systems often struggle with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms, which do not appear in training data. Blends, such as "innoventor", are one particularly challenging class of OOV, as they are formed by fusing together two or more bases that relate to the intended meaning in unpredictable manners and degrees. In this work, we run experiments on a novel dataset of English OOV blends to quantify the difficulty of interpreting the meanings of blends by large-scale contextual language models such as BERT. We first show that BERT's processing of these blends does not fully access the component meanings, leaving their contextual representations semantically impoverished. We find this is mostly due to the loss of characters resulting from blend formation. Then, we assess how easily different models can recognize the structure and recover the origin of blends, and find that context-aware embedding systems outperform character-level and context-free embeddings, although their results are still far from satisfactory.

title:  EMNLP 2020: Evaluating and Characterizing Human Rationales
authors:  Samuel Carton
abstract:  Two main approaches for evaluating the quality of machine-generated rationales are: 1) using human rationales as a gold standard; and 2) automated metrics based on how rationales affect model behavior. An open question, however, is how human rationales fare with these automatic metrics. Analyzing a variety of datasets and models, we find that human rationales do not necessarily perform well on these metrics. To unpack this finding, we propose improved metrics to account for model-dependent baseline performance. We then propose two methods to further characterize rationale quality, one based on model retraining and one on using "fidelity curves" to reveal properties such as irrelevance and redundancy. Our work leads to actionable suggestions for evaluating and characterizing rationales.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] Accelerating Approximate Bayesian Computation for Covid-19 Models
authors:  Graphcore
abstract:  Epidemiology models are central in understanding and controlling large scale pandemics. Several epidemiology models require simulation-based inference such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit their parameters to observations. ABC inference is highly amenable to efficient hardware acceleration. In this work, we develop parallel ABC inference of a stochastic epidemiology model for COVID-19. The statistical inference framework is implemented and compared on Intel Xeon CPU, NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU and the Graphcore Mk1 IPU, and the results are discussed in the context of their computational architectures. Results show that GPUs are 4x and IPUs are 30x faster than Xeon CPUs. Extensive performance analysis indicates that the difference between IPU and GPU can be attributed to higher communication bandwidth, closeness of memory to compute, and higher compute power in the IPU. The proposed framework scales across 16 IPUs, with scaling overhead not exceeding 8% for the experiments performed. We present an example of our framework in practice, performing inference on the epidemiology model across three countries, and giving a brief overview of the results.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] Training Neural Networks in Low Dimensional Random Bases
authors:  Graphcore
abstract:  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has proven to be remarkably effective in optimizing deep neural networks that employ ever-larger numbers of parameters. Yet, improving the efficiency of large-scale optimization remains a vital and highly active area of research. Recent work has shown that deep neural networks can be optimized in randomly-projected subspaces of much smaller dimensionality than their native parameter space. While such training is promising for more efficient and scalable optimization schemes, its practical application is limited by inferior optimization performance. Here, we improve on recent random subspace approaches as follows: Firstly, we show that keeping the random projection fixed throughout training is detrimental to optimization. We propose re-drawing the random subspace at each step, which yields significantly better performance. We realize further improvements by applying independent projections to different parts of the network, making the approximation more efficient as network dimensionality grows. To implement these experiments, we leverage hardware-accelerated pseudo-random number generation to construct the random projections on-demand at every optimization step, allowing us to distribute the computation of independent random directions across multiple workers with shared random seeds. This yields significant reductions in memory and is up to 10 times faster for the workloads in question.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] NVAE: A Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder 
authors:  Yannic Kilcher
abstract:  Normalizing flows, autoregressive models, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and deep energy-based models are among competing likelihood-based frameworks for deep generative learning. Among them, VAEs have the advantage of fast and tractable sampling and easy-to-access encoding networks. However, they are currently outperformed by other models such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models. While the majority of the research in VAEs is focused on the statistical challenges, we explore the orthogonal direction of carefully designing neural architectures for hierarchical VAEs. We propose Nouveau VAE (NVAE), a deep hierarchical VAE built for image generation using depth-wise separable convolutions and batch normalization. NVAE is equipped with a residual parameterization of Normal distributions and its training is stabilized by spectral regularization. We show that NVAE achieves state-of-the-art results among non-autoregressive likelihood-based models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA 64, and CelebA HQ datasets and it provides a strong baseline on FFHQ. For example, on CIFAR-10, NVAE pushes the state-of-the-art from 2.98 to 2.91 bits per dimension, and it produces high-quality images on CelebA HQ. To the best of our knowledge, NVAE is the first successful VAE applied to natural images as large as 256×256 pixels.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] What Makes for Good Views for Contrastive Learning?
authors:  Computer Vision Seminar
abstract:  ontrastive learning between multiple views of the data has recently achieved state of the art performance in the field of self-supervised representation learning. Despite its success, the influence of different view choices has been less studied. In this paper, we use theoretical and empirical analysis to better understand the importance of view selection, and argue that we should reduce the mutual information (MI) between views while keeping task-relevant information intact. To verify this hypothesis, we devise unsupervised and semi-supervised frameworks that learn effective views by aiming to reduce their MI. We also consider data augmentation as a way to reduce MI, and show that increasing data augmentation indeed leads to decreasing MI and improves downstream classification accuracy. As a by-product, we achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy on unsupervised pre-training for ImageNet classification (73% top-1 linear readout with a ResNet-50). In addition, transferring our models to PASCAL VOC object detection and COCO instance segmentation consistently outperforms supervised pre-training.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] Differentiable Augmentation for Data-Efficient GAN Training
authors:  MIT HAN Lab
abstract:  The performance of generative adversarial networks (GANs) heavily deteriorates given a limited amount of training data. This is mainly because the discriminator is memorizing the exact training set. To combat it, we propose Differentiable Augmentation (DiffAugment), a simple method that improves the data efficiency of GANs by imposing various types of differentiable augmentations on both real and fake samples. Previous attempts to directly augment the training data manipulate the distribution of real images, yielding little benefit; DiffAugment enables us to adopt the differentiable augmentation for the generated samples, effectively stabilizes training, and leads to better convergence. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our method over a variety of GAN architectures and loss functions for both unconditional and class-conditional generation. With DiffAugment, we achieve a state-of-the-art FID of 6.80 with an IS of 100.8 on ImageNet 128x128 and 2-4x reductions of FID given 1,000 images on FFHQ and LSUN. Furthermore, with only 20% training data, we can match the top performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Finally, our method can generate high-fidelity images using only 100 images without pre-training, while being on par with existing transfer learning algorithms.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] FixMatch: Simplifying Semi-Supervised Learning with Consistency and Confidence
authors:  Yannic Kilcher
abstract:  Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an effective means of leveraging unlabeled data to improve a model's performance. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of a simple combination of two common SSL methods: consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. Our algorithm, FixMatch, first generates pseudo-labels using the model's predictions on weakly-augmented unlabeled images. For a given image, the pseudo-label is only retained if the model produces a high-confidence prediction. The model is then trained to predict the pseudo-label when fed a strongly-augmented version of the same image. Despite its simplicity, we show that FixMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, including 94.93% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 250 labels and 88.61% accuracy with 40 -- just 4 labels per class. Since FixMatch bears many similarities to existing SSL methods that achieve worse performance, we carry out an extensive ablation study to tease apart the experimental factors that are most important to FixMatch's success.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] Differentiable Expected Hypervolume Improvement for Parallel Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization
authors:  Samuel Daulton
abstract:  In many real-world scenarios, decision makers seek to efficiently optimize multiple competing objectives in a sample-efficient fashion. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (BO) is a common approach, but many of the best-performing acquisition functions do not have known analytic gradients and suffer from high computational overhead. We leverage recent advances in programming models and hardware acceleration for multi-objective BO using Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI)---an algorithm notorious for its high computational complexity. We derive a novel formulation of q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI), an acquisition function that extends EHVI to the parallel, constrained evaluation setting. qEHVI is an exact computation of the joint EHVI of q new candidate points (up to Monte-Carlo (MC) integration error). Whereas previous EHVI formulations rely on gradient-free acquisition optimization or approximated gradients, we compute exact gradients of the MC estimator via auto-differentiation, thereby enabling efficient and effective optimization using first-order and quasi-second-order methods. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that qEHVI is computationally tractable in many practical scenarios and outperforms state-of-the-art multi-objective BO algorithms at a fraction of their wall time.

title:  Compact task representation as a normative model for higher-order brain activity
authors:  Severin Berger
abstract:  Higher-order brain areas such as the frontal cortices are considered essential for the flexible solution of tasks. However, the precise computational role of these areas is still debated. Indeed, even for the simplest of tasks, we cannot really explain how the measured brain activity, which evolves over time in complicated ways, relates to the task structure. Here, we follow a normative approach, based on integrating the principle of efficient coding with the framework of Markov decision processes (MDP). More specifically, we focus on MDPs whose state is based on action-observation histories, and we show how to compress the state space such that unnecessary redundancy is eliminated, while task-relevant information is preserved. We show that the efficiency of a state space representation depends on the (long-term) behavioural goal of the agent, and we distinguish between model-based and habitual agents. We apply our approach to simple tasks that require short-term memory, and we show that the efficient state space representations reproduce the key dynamical features of recorded neural activity in frontal areas (such as ramping, sequentiality, persistence). If we additionally assume that neural systems are subject to accuracy-cost tradeoffs, we find a surprising match to neural data on a population level.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] Bootstrapping Neural Processes
authors:  Juho Lee
abstract:  Unlike in the traditional statistical modeling for which a user typically hand-specify a prior, Neural Processes (NPs) implicitly define a broad class of stochastic processes with neural networks. Given a data stream, NP learns a stochastic process that best describes the data. While this "data-driven" way of learning stochastic processes has proven to handle various types of data, NPs still rely on an assumption that uncertainty in stochastic processes is modeled by a single latent variable, which potentially limits the flexibility. To this end, we propose the Boostrapping Neural Process (BNP), a novel extension of the NP family using the bootstrap. The bootstrap is a classical data-driven technique for estimating uncertainty, which allows BNP to learn the stochasticity in NPs without assuming a particular form. We demonstrate the efficacy of BNP on various types of data and its robustness in the presence of model-data mismatch.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020 Spotlight] NeuralMeshFlow 3D Manifold Mesh Generation via Diffeomorphic Flows
authors:  Kunal Gupta
abstract:  Meshes are important representations of physical 3D entities in the virtual world. Applications like rendering, simulations and 3D printing require meshes to be manifold so that they can interact with the world like the real objects they represent. Prior methods generate meshes with great geometric accuracy but poor manifoldness. In this work, we propose Neural Mesh Flow (NMF) to generate two-manifold meshes for genus-0 shapes. Specifically, NMF is a shape auto-encoder consisting of several Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE)[1] blocks that learn accurate mesh geometry by progressively deforming a spherical mesh. Training NMF is simpler compared to state-of-the-art methods since it does not require any explicit mesh-based regularization. Our experiments demonstrate that NMF facilitates several applications such as single-view mesh reconstruction, global shape parameterization, texture mapping, shape deformation and correspondence. Importantly, we demonstrate that manifold meshes generated using NMF are better-suited for physically-based rendering and simulation. Code and data are released.

authors:  Oleksandr Shchur
abstract:  Temporal point process (TPP) models combined with recurrent neural networks provide a powerful framework for modeling continuous-time event data. While such models are flexible, they are inherently sequential and therefore cannot benefit from the parallelism of modern hardware. By exploiting the recent developments in the field of normalizing flows, we design TriTPP -- a new class of non-recurrent TPP models, where both sampling and likelihood computation can be done in parallel. TriTPP matches the flexibility of RNN-based methods but permits orders of magnitude faster sampling. This enables us to use the new model for variational inference in continuous-time discrete-state systems. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework on synthetic and real-world datasets.

title:  Efficient Exact Verification of Binarized Neural Networks
authors:  Kai Jia
abstract:  Concerned with the reliability of neural networks, researchers have developed verification techniques to prove their robustness. Most verifiers work with real-valued networks. Unfortunately, the exact (complete and sound) verifiers face scalability challenges and provide no correctness guarantees due to floating point errors. We argue that Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) provide comparable robustness and allow exact and significantly more efficient verification. We present a new system, EEV, for efficient and exact verification of BNNs. EEV consists of two parts: (i) a novel SAT solver that speeds up BNN verification by natively handling the reified cardinality constraints arising in BNN encodings; and (ii) strategies to train solver-friendly robust BNNs by inducing balanced layer-wise sparsity and low cardinality bounds, and adaptively cancelling the gradients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EEV by presenting the first exact verification results for L-inf-bounded adversarial robustness of nontrivial convolutional BNNs on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Compared to exact verification of real-valued networks of the same architectures on the same tasks, EEV verifies BNNs hundreds to thousands of times faster, while delivering comparable verifiable accuracy in most cases.

title:  Estimating Fluctuations in Neural Representations of Uncertain Environments
authors:  Sahand Farhoodi
abstract:  Neural Coding analyses often reflect an assumption that neural populations respond uniquely and consistently to particular stimuli. For example, analyses of spatial remapping in hippocampal populations often assume that each environment has one unique representation and that remapping occurs over long time scales as an animal traverses between distinct environments. However, as neuroscience experiments begin to explore more naturalistic tasks and stimuli, and reflect more ambiguity in neural representations, methods for analyzing population neural codes must adapt to reflect these features. In this paper, we develop a new state-space modeling framework to address two important issues related to remapping. First, neurons may exhibit significant trial-to-trial or moment-to-moment variability in the firing patterns used to represent a particular environment or stimulus. Second, in ambiguous environments and tasks that involve cognitive uncertainty, neural populations may rapidly fluctuate between multiple representations. The state-space model addresses these two issues by integrating an observation model, which allows for multiple representations of the same stimulus or environment, with a state model, which characterizes the moment-by-moment probability of a shift in the neural representation. These models allow us to compute instantaneous estimates of the stimulus or environment currently represented by the population. We demonstrate the application of this approach to the analysis of population activity in the CA1 region of hippocampus of a mouse moving through ambiguous virtual environments. Our analyses demonstrate that many hippocampal cells express significant trial-to-trial variability in their representations and that the population representation can fluctuate rapidly between environments within a single trial when spatial cues are most ambiguous.

title:  Gradient Boosted Normalizing Flows
authors:  Robert Giaquinto
abstract:  By chaining a sequence of differentiable invertible transformations, normalizing flows (NF) provide an expressive method of posterior approximation, exact density evaluation, and sampling. The trend in normalizing flow literature has been to devise deeper, more complex transformations to achieve greater flexibility. We propose an alternative: Gradient Boosted Normalizing Flows (GBNF) model a density by successively adding new NF components with gradient boosting. Under the boosting framework, each new NF component optimizes a sample weighted likelihood objective, resulting in new components that are fit to the residuals of the previously trained components. The GBNF formulation results in a mixture model structure, whose flexibility increases as more components are added. Moreover, GBNFs offer a wider, as opposed to strictly deeper, approach that improves existing NFs at the cost of additional training---not more complex transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique for density estimation and, by coupling GBNF with a variational autoencoder, generative modeling of images. Our results show that GBNFs outperform their non-boosted analog, and, in some cases, produce better results with smaller, simpler flows.

title:  Learning Robust Decision Policies from Observational Data
authors:  Muhammad Osama
abstract:  We address the problem of learning a decision policy from observational data of past decisions in contexts with features and associated outcomes. The past policy maybe unknown and in safety-critical applications, such as medical decision support, it is of interest to learn robust policies that reduce the risk of outcomes with high costs. In this paper, we develop a method for learning policies that reduce tails of the cost distribution at a specified level and, moreover, provide a statistically valid bound on the cost of each decision. These properties are valid under finite samples -- even in scenarios with uneven or no overlap between features for different decisions in the observed data -- by building on recent results in conformal prediction. The performance and statistical properties of the proposed method are illustrated using both real and synthetic data.

title:  Neural Complexity Measures
authors:  Yoonho Lee
abstract:  While various complexity measures for deep neural networks exist, specifying an appropriate measure capable of predicting and explaining generalization in deep networks has proven challenging. We propose Neural Complexity (NC), a meta-learning framework for predicting generalization. Our model learns a scalar complexity measure through interactions with many heterogeneous tasks in a data-driven way. The trained NC model can be added to the standard training loss to regularize any task learner in a standard supervised learning scenario. We contrast NC's approach against existing manually-designed complexity measures and other meta-learning models, and we validate NC's performance on multiple regression and classification tasks

title:  Optimal Variance Control of the Score-Function Gradient Estimator for Importance-Weighted Bounds
authors:  Valentin Liévin
abstract:  This paper introduces novel results for the score function gradient estimator of the importance weighted variational bound (IWAE). We prove that in the limit of large K (number of importance samples) one can choose the control variate such that the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) of the estimator grows as K‾‾√. This is in contrast to the standard pathwise gradient estimator where the SNR decreases as 1/K‾‾√. Based on our theoretical findings we develop a novel control variate that extends on VIMCO. Empirically, for the training of both continuous and discrete generative models, the proposed method yields superior variance reduction, resulting in an SNR for IWAE that increases with K without relying on the reparameterization trick. The novel estimator is competitive with state-of-the-art reparameterization-free gradient estimators such as Reweighted Wake-Sleep (RWS) and the thermodynamic variational objective (TVO) when training generative models.

title:  ShiftAddNet: A Hardware-Inspired Deep Network
authors:  Haoran You
abstract:  Multiplication (e.g., convolution) is arguably a cornerstone of modern deep neural networks (DNNs). However, intensive multiplications cause expensive resource costs that challenge DNNs' deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, driving several attempts for multiplication-less deep networks. This paper presented ShiftAddNet, whose main inspiration is drawn from a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation, that is, multiplication can be instead performed with additions and logical bit-shifts. We leverage this idea to explicitly parameterize deep networks in this way, yielding a new type of deep network that involves only bit-shift and additive weight layers. This hardware-inspired ShiftAddNet immediately leads to both energy-efficient inference and training, without compromising the expressive capacity compared to standard DNNs. The two complementary operation types (bit-shift and add) additionally enable finer-grained control of the model's learning capacity, leading to more flexible trade-off between accuracy and (training) efficiency, as well as improved robustness to quantization and pruning. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies, all backed up by our FPGA-based ShiftAddNet implementation and energy measurements. Compared to existing DNNs or other multiplication-less models, ShiftAddNet aggressively reduces over 80% hardware-quantified energy cost of DNNs training and inference, while offering comparable or better accuracies.

title:  STEER:  Simple Temporal Regularization For Neural ODE
authors:  Arnab Ghosh
abstract:  Training Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is often computationally expensive. Indeed, computing the forward pass of such models involves solving an ODE which can become arbitrarily complex during training. Recent works have shown that regularizing the dynamics of the ODE can partially alleviate this. In this paper we propose a new regularization technique: randomly sampling the end time of the ODE during training. The proposed regularization is simple to implement, has negligible overhead and is effective across a wide variety of tasks. Further, the technique is orthogonal to several other methods proposed to regularize the dynamics of ODEs and as such can be used in conjunction with them. We show through experiments on normalizing flows, time series models and image recognition that the proposed regularization can significantly decrease training time and even improve performance over baseline models.

title:  Synbols: Probing Learning Algorithms with Synthetic Datasets
authors:  Alexandre Lacoste
abstract:  Progress in the field of machine learning has been fueled by the introduction of benchmark datasets pushing the limits of existing algorithms. Enabling the design of datasets to test specific properties and failure modes of learning algorithms is thus a problem of high interest, as it has a direct impact on innovation in the field. In this sense, we introduce Synbols -- Synthetic Symbols -- a tool for rapidly generating new datasets with a rich composition of latent features rendered in low resolution images. Synbols leverages the large amount of symbols available in the Unicode standard and the wide range of artistic font provided by the open font community. Our tool's high-level interface provides a language for rapidly generating new distributions on the latent features, including various types of textures and occlusions. To showcase the versatility of Synbols, we use it to dissect the limitations and flaws in standard learning algorithms in various learning setups including supervised learning, active learning, out of distribution generalization, unsupervised representation learning, and object counting.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] Fourier Features Let Networks Learn High Frequency Functions in Low Dimensional Domains
authors:  Matthew Tancik
abstract:  We show that passing input points through a simple Fourier feature mapping enables a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn high-frequency functions in low-dimensional problem domains. These results shed light on recent advances in computer vision and graphics that achieve state-of-the-art results by using MLPs to represent complex 3D objects and scenes. Using tools from the neural tangent kernel (NTK) literature, we show that a standard MLP fails to learn high frequencies both in theory and in practice. To overcome this spectral bias, we use a Fourier feature mapping to transform the effective NTK into a stationary kernel with a tunable bandwidth. We suggest an approach for selecting problem-specific Fourier features that greatly improves the performance of MLPs for low-dimensional regression tasks relevant to the computer vision and graphics communities.

title:  Shared Space Transfer Learning for analyzing multi-site fMRI data [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  Muhammad Yousefnezhad
abstract:  Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) learns predictive models from task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, for distinguishing when subjects are performing different cognitive tasks -- e.g., watching movies or making decisions. MVPA works best with a well-designed feature set and an adequate sample size. However, most fMRI datasets are noisy, high-dimensional, expensive to collect, and with small sample sizes. Further, training a robust, generalized predictive model that can analyze homogeneous cognitive tasks provided by multi-site fMRI datasets has additional challenges. This paper proposes the Shared Space Transfer Learning (SSTL) as a novel transfer learning (TL) approach that can functionally align homogeneous multi-site fMRI datasets, and so improve the prediction performance in every site. SSTL first extracts a set of common features for all subjects in each site. It then uses TL to map these site-specific features to a site-independent shared space in order to improve the performance of the MVPA. SSTL uses a scalable optimization procedure that works effectively for high-dimensional fMRI datasets. The optimization procedure extracts the common features for each site by using a single-iteration algorithm and maps these site-specific common features to the site-independent shared space. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for transferring between various cognitive tasks. Our comprehensive experiments validate that SSTL achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art analysis techniques.

title:  Causal Discovery in Physical Systems from Videos [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  Yunzhu Li
abstract:  Causal discovery is at the core of human cognition. It enables us to reason about the environment and make counterfactual predictions about unseen scenarios that can vastly differ from our previous experiences. We consider the task of causal discovery from videos in an end-to-end fashion without supervision on the ground-truth graph structure. In particular, our goal is to discover the structural dependencies among environmental and object variables: inferring the type and strength of interactions that have a causal effect on the behavior of the dynamical system. Our model consists of (a) a perception module that extracts a semantically meaningful and temporally consistent keypoint representation from images, (b) an inference module for determining the graph distribution induced by the detected keypoints, and (c) a dynamics module that can predict the future by conditioning on the inferred graph. We assume access to different configurations and environmental conditions, i.e., data from unknown interventions on the underlying system; thus, we can hope to discover the correct underlying causal graph without explicit interventions. We evaluate our method in a planar multi-body interaction environment and scenarios involving fabrics of different shapes like shirts and pants. Experiments demonstrate that our model can correctly identify the interactions from a short sequence of images and make long-term future predictions. The causal structure assumed by the model also allows it to make counterfactual predictions and extrapolate to systems of unseen interaction graphs or graphs of various sizes.

title:  An analytic theory of shallow networks dynamics for hinge loss classification
authors:  Franco Pellegrini
abstract:  Neural networks have been shown to perform incredibly well in classification tasks over structured high-dimensional datasets. However, the learning dynamics of such networks is still poorly understood. In this paper we study in detail the training dynamics of a simple type of neural network: a single hidden layer trained to perform a classification task. We show that in a suitable mean-field limit this case maps to a single-node learning problem with a time-dependent dataset determined self-consistently from the average nodes population. We specialize our theory to the prototypical case of a linearly separable dataset and a linear hinge loss, for which the dynamics can be explicitly solved. This allows us to address in a simple setting several phenomena appearing in modern networks such as slowing down of training dynamics, crossover between rich and lazy learning, and overfitting. Finally, we assess the limitations of mean-field theory by studying the case of large but finite number of nodes and of training samples.

title:  [Spotlight at NeurIPS 2020] Optimal Private Median Estimation under Minimal Distributional Assumptions
authors:  Εμμανούλ Βλατάκης
abstract:  We study the fundamental task of estimating the median of an underlying distribution from a finite number of samples, under pure differential privacy constraints. We focus on distributions satisfying the minimal assumption that they have a positive density at a small neighborhood around the median.  In particular, the distribution is allowed to output unbounded values and is not required to have finite moments. We compute the exact, up-to-constant terms, statistical rate of estimation for the median by providing nearly-tight upper and lower bounds. Furthermore, we design a polynomial-time differentially private algorithm which provably achieves the optimal performance.  At a technical level, our results leverage a LipschitzExtension Lemma which allows us to design and analyze differentially private algorithms solely on appropriately defined “typical” instances of the samples

title:  Neural Networks with Recurrent Generative Feedback
authors:  Yujia Huang
abstract:  Neural networks are vulnerable to input perturbations such as additive noise and adversarial attacks. In contrast, human perception is much more robust to such perturbations. The Bayesian brain hypothesis states that human brains use an internal generative model to update the posterior beliefs of the sensory input. This mechanism can be interpreted as a form of self-consistency between the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of an internal generative model and the external environment. Inspired by such hypothesis, we enforce self-consistency in neural networks by incorporating generative recurrent feedback. We instantiate this design on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed framework, termed Convolutional Neural Networks with Feedback (CNN-F), introduces a generative feedback with latent variables to existing CNN architectures, where consistent predictions are made through alternating MAP inference under a Bayesian framework. In the experiments, CNN-F shows considerably improved adversarial robustness over conventional feedforward CNNs on standard benchmarks.

title:  Bandit-PAM: Almost Linear Time k-Medoids Clustering via Multi-Armed Bandits
authors:  Mo Tiwari
abstract:  Clustering is a ubiquitous task in data science. Compared to the commonly used k-means clustering algorithm, k-medoids clustering algorithms require the cluster centers to be actual data points and support arbitrary distance metrics, allowing for greater interpretability and the clustering of structured objects. Current state-of-the-art k-medoids clustering algorithms, such as Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), are iterative and are quadratic in the dataset size n for each iteration, being prohibitively expensive for large datasets. We propose Bandit-PAM, a randomized algorithm inspired by techniques from multi-armed bandits, that significantly improves the computational efficiency of PAM. We theoretically prove that Bandit-PAM reduces the complexity of each PAM iteration from O(n2) to O(nlogn) and returns the same results with high probability, under assumptions on the data that often hold in practice. We empirically validate our results on several large-scale real-world datasets, including a coding exercise submissions dataset from this http URL, the 10x Genomics 68k PBMC single-cell RNA sequencing dataset, and the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. We observe that Bandit-PAM returns the same results as PAM while performing up to 200x fewer distance computations. The improvements demonstrated by Bandit-PAM enable k-medoids clustering on a wide range of applications, including identifying cell types in large-scale single-cell data and providing scalable feedback for students learning computer science online. We also release Python and C++ implementations of our algorithm.

title:  The Generalization-Stability Tradeoff In Neural Network Pruning
authors:  Brian R. Bartoldson
abstract:  Pruning neural network parameters is often viewed as a means to compress models, but pruning has also been motivated by the desire to prevent overfitting. This motivation is particularly relevant given the perhaps surprising observation that a wide variety of pruning approaches increase test accuracy despite sometimes massive reductions in parameter counts. To better understand this phenomenon, we analyze the behavior of pruning over the course of training, finding that pruning's benefit to generalization increases with pruning's instability (defined as the drop in test accuracy immediately following pruning). We demonstrate that this "generalization-stability tradeoff" is present across a wide variety of pruning settings and propose a mechanism for its cause: pruning regularizes similarly to noise injection. Supporting this, we find less pruning stability leads to more model flatness and the benefits of pruning do not depend on permanent parameter removal. These results explain the compatibility of pruning-based generalization improvements and the high generalization recently observed in overparameterized networks.

title:  Why Normalizing Flows Fail to Detect Out-of-Distribution Data
authors:  Polina Kirichenko
abstract:  Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial for robust machine learning systems. Normalizing flows are flexible deep generative models that often surprisingly fail to distinguish between in- and out-of-distribution data: a flow trained on pictures of clothing assigns higher likelihood to handwritten digits. We investigate why normalizing flows perform poorly for OOD detection. We demonstrate that flows learn local pixel correlations and generic image-to-latent-space transformations which are not specific to the target image dataset. We show that by modifying the architecture of flow coupling layers we can bias the flow towards learning the semantic structure of the target data, improving OOD detection. Our investigation reveals that properties that enable flows to generate high-fidelity images can have a detrimental effect on OOD detection.

title:  Does Unsupervised Architecture Representation Learning Help Neural Architecture Search?
authors:  Shen Yan
abstract:  Existing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods either encode neural architectures using discrete encodings that do not scale well, or adopt supervised learning-based methods to jointly learn architecture representations and optimize architecture search on such representations which incurs search bias. Despite the widespread use, architecture representations learned in NAS are still poorly understood. We observe that the structural properties of neural architectures are hard to preserve in the latent space if architecture representation learning and search are coupled, resulting in less effective search performance. In this work, we find empirically that pre-training architecture representations using only neural architectures without their accuracies as labels improves the downstream architecture search efficiency. To explain this finding, we visualize how unsupervised architecture representation learning better encourages neural architectures with similar connections and operators to cluster together. This helps map neural architectures with similar performance to the same regions in the latent space and makes the transition of architectures in the latent space relatively smooth, which considerably benefits diverse downstream search strategies.

title:  A Measure-Theoretic Approach to Kernel Conditional Mean Embeddings
authors:  Junhyung Park
abstract:  We present an operator-free, measure-theoretic approach to the conditional mean embedding (CME) as a random variable taking values in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. While the kernel mean embedding of unconditional distributions has been defined rigorously, the existing operator-based approach of the conditional version depends on stringent assumptions that hinder its analysis. We overcome this limitation via a measure-theoretic treatment of CMEs. We derive a natural regression interpretation to obtain empirical estimates, and provide a thorough theoretical analysis thereof, including universal consistency. As natural by-products, we obtain the conditional analogues of the maximum mean discrepancy and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion, and demonstrate their behaviour via simulations.

title:  Log-Likelihood Ratio Minimizing Flows: Towards Robust and Quantifiable Neural Distribution Alignment
authors:  Ben Usman
abstract:  Distribution alignment has many applications in deep learning, including domain adaptation and unsupervised image-to-image translation. Most prior work on unsupervised distribution alignment relies either on minimizing simple non-parametric statistical distances such as maximum mean discrepancy or on adversarial alignment. However, the former fails to capture the structure of complex real-world distributions, while the latter is difficult to train and does not provide any universal convergence guarantees or automatic quantitative validation procedures. In this paper, we propose a new distribution alignment method based on a log-likelihood ratio statistic and normalizing flows. We show that, under certain assumptions, this combination yields a deep neural likelihood-based minimization objective that attains a known lower bound upon convergence. We experimentally verify that minimizing the resulting objective results in domain alignment that preserves the local structure of input domains.

title:  [Oral at NeurIPS 2020] Multiscale Deep Equilibrium Models
authors:  Shaojie Bai
abstract:  We propose a new class of implicit networks, the multiscale deep equilibrium model (MDEQ), suited to large-scale and highly hierarchical pattern recognition domains. An MDEQ directly solves for and backpropagates through the equilibrium points of multiple feature resolutions simultaneously, using implicit differentiation to avoid storing intermediate states (and thus requiring only O(1) memory consumption). These simultaneously-learned multi-resolution features allow us to train a single model on a diverse set of tasks and loss functions, such as using a single MDEQ to perform both image classification and semantic segmentation. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach on two large-scale vision tasks: ImageNet classification and semantic segmentation on high-resolution images from the Cityscapes dataset. In both settings, MDEQs are able to match or exceed the performance of recent competitive computer vision models: the first time such performance and scale have been achieved by an implicit deep learning approach.

title:  Mitigating Forgetting in Online Continual Learning via Instance-Aware Parameterization
authors:  Hung-Jen Chen
abstract:  Online continual learning is a challenging scenario where a model needs to learn from a continuous stream of data without revisiting any previously encountered data instances. The phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting is worsened since the model should not only address the forgetting at the task-level but also at the data instance-level within the same task. To mitigate this, we leverage the concept of "instance awareness" in the neural network, where each data instance is classified by a path in the network searched by the controller from a meta-graph. To preserve the knowledge we learn from previous instances, we proposed a method to protect the path by restricting the gradient updates of one instance from overriding past updates calculated from previous instances if these instances are not similar. On the other hand, it also encourages fine-tuning the path if the incoming instance shares the similarity with previous instances. The mechanism of selecting paths according to instances similarity is naturally determined by the controller, which is compact and online updated. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-arts in online continual learning. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against a realistic setting where the boundaries between tasks are blurred. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet.

title:  Mixed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Mixed Discrete and Continuous Variables
authors:  Guangyao Zhou
abstract:  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has emerged as a powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to sample from complex continuous distributions. However, a fundamental limitation of HMC is that it can not be applied to distributions with mixed discrete and continuous variables. In this paper, we propose mixed HMC (M-HMC) as a general framework to address this limitation. M-HMC is a novel family of MCMC algorithms that evolves the discrete and continuous variables in tandem, allowing more frequent updates of discrete variables while maintaining HMC's ability to suppress random-walk behavior. We establish M-HMC's theoretical properties, and present an efficient implementation with Laplace momentum that introduces minimal overhead compared to existing HMC methods. The superior performances of M-HMC over existing methods are demonstrated with numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), variable selection in Bayesian logistic regression (BLR), and correlated topic models (CTMs).

title:  Learning Continuous System Dynamics fromIrregularly-Sampled Partial Observations
authors:  Yizhou Sun
abstract:  Many real-world systems, such as moving planets, can be considered as multi-agent dynamic systems, where objects interact with each other and co-evolve along with the time. Such dynamics is usually difficult to capture, and understanding and predicting the dynamics based on observed trajectories of objects become a critical research problem in many domains. Most existing algorithms, however, assume the observations are regularly sampled and all the objects can be fully observed at each sampling time, which is impractical for many applications. In this paper, we propose to learn system dynamics from irregularly-sampled partial observations with underlying graph structure for the first time. To tackle the above challenge, we present LG-ODE, a latent ordinary differential equation generative model for modeling multi-agent dynamic system with known graph structure. It can simultaneously learn the embedding of high dimensional trajectories and infer continuous latent system dynamics. Our model employs a novel encoder parameterized by a graph neural network that can infer initial states in an unsupervised way from irregularly-sampled partial observations of structural objects and utilizes neuralODE to infer arbitrarily complex continuous-time latent dynamics. Experiments on motion capture, spring system, and charged particle datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

title:  [Oral at NeurIPS 2020] Deep Transformation-Invariant Clustering
authors:  Tom Monnier
abstract:  features but instead learns to predict image transformations and directly performs clustering in pixel space. This learning process naturally fits in the gradient-based training of K-means and Gaussian mixture model, without requiring any additional loss or hyper-parameters. It leads us to two new deep transformation-invariant clustering frameworks, which jointly learn prototypes and transformations. More specifically, we use deep learning modules that enable us to resolve invariance to spatial, color and morphological transformations. Our approach is conceptually simple and comes with several advantages, including the possibility to easily adapt the desired invariance to the task and a strong interpretability of both cluster centers and assignments to clusters. We demonstrate that our novel approach yields competitive and highly promising results on standard image clustering benchmarks. Finally, we showcase its robustness and the advantages of its improved interpretability by visualizing clustering results over real photograph collections.

title:  [Spotlight at NeurIPS 2020] Learning Affordance Landscapes for Interaction Exploration in 3D Environments
authors:  Tushar Nagarajan
abstract:  Embodied agents operating in human spaces must be able to master how their environment works: what objects can the agent use, and how can it use them? We introduce a reinforcement learning approach for exploration for interaction, whereby an embodied agent autonomously discovers the affordance landscape of a new unmapped 3D environment (such as an unfamiliar kitchen). Given an egocentric RGB-D camera and a high-level action space, the agent is rewarded for maximizing successful interactions while simultaneously training an image-based affordance segmentation model. The former yields a policy for acting efficiently in new environments to prepare for downstream interaction tasks, while the latter yields a convolutional neural network that maps image regions to the likelihood they permit each action, densifying the rewards for exploration. We demonstrate our idea with AI2-iTHOR. The results show agents can learn how to use new home environments intelligently and that it prepares them to rapidly address various downstream tasks like "find a knife and put it in the drawer.

title:  Finding the Homology of Decision Boundaries with Active Learning
authors:  Weizhi Li
abstract:  Accurately and efficiently characterizing the decision boundary of classifiers is important for problems related to model selection and meta-learning. Inspired by topological data analysis, the characterization of decision boundaries using their homology has recently emerged as a general and powerful tool. In this paper, we propose an active learning algorithm to recover the homology of decision boundaries. Our algorithm sequentially and adaptively selects which samples it requires the labels of. We theoretically analyze the proposed framework and show that the query complexity of our active learning algorithm depends naturally on the intrinsic complexity of the underlying manifold. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in selecting best-performing machine learning models for datasets just using their respective homological summaries. Experiments on several standard datasets show the sample complexity improvement in recovering the homology and demonstrate the practical utility of the framework for model selection.

authors:  Yayi Zou
abstract:  Bayesian meta-learning enables robust and fast adaptation to new tasks with uncertainty assessment. The key idea behind Bayesian meta-learning is empirical Bayes inference of hierarchical model. In this work, we extend this framework to include a variety of existing methods, before proposing our variant based on gradient-EM algorithm. Our method improves computational efficiency by avoiding back-propagation computation in the meta-update step, which is exhausting for deep neural networks. Furthermore, it provides flexibility to the inner-update optimization procedure by decoupling it from meta-update. Experiments on sinusoidal regression, few-shot image classification, and policy-based reinforcement learning show that our method not only achieves better accuracy with less computation cost, but is also more robust to uncertainty.

title:  Skeleton-bridged Point Completion: From Global Inference to Local Adjustment 
authors:  Yinyu Nie
abstract:  Point completion refers to complete the missing geometries of objects from partial point clouds. Existing works usually estimate the missing shape by decoding a latent feature encoded from the input points. However, real-world objects are usually with diverse topologies and surface details, which a latent feature may fail to represent to recover a clean and complete surface. To this end, we propose a skeleton-bridged point completion network (SK-PCN) for shape completion. Given a partial scan, our method first predicts its 3D skeleton to obtain the global structure, and completes the surface by learning displacements from skeletal points. We decouple the shape completion into structure estimation and surface reconstruction, which eases the learning difficulty and benefits our method to obtain on-surface details. Besides, considering the missing features during encoding input points, SK-PCN adopts a local adjustment strategy that merges the input point cloud to our predictions for surface refinement. Comparing with previous methods, our skeleton-bridged manner better supports point normal estimation to obtain the full surface mesh beyond point clouds. The qualitative and quantitative experiments on both point cloud and mesh completion show that our approach outperforms the existing methods on various object categories.

title:  [Spotlight at NeurIPS 2020] AdaBelief Optimizer: Adapting Stepsizes by the Belief in Observed Gradients 
authors:  Juntang Zhuang
abstract:  Most popular optimizers for deep learning can be broadly categorized as adaptive methods (e.g. Adam) and accelerated schemes (e.g. stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum). For many models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), adaptive methods typically converge faster but generalize worse compared to SGD; for complex settings such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), adaptive methods are typically the default because of their stability.We propose AdaBelief to simultaneously achieve three goals: fast convergence as in adaptive methods, good generalization as in SGD, and training stability. The intuition for AdaBelief is to adapt the stepsize according to the "belief" in the current gradient direction. Viewing the exponential moving average (EMA) of the noisy gradient as the prediction of the gradient at the next time step, if the observed gradient greatly deviates from the prediction, we distrust the current observation and take a small step; if the observed gradient is close to the prediction, we trust it and take a large step. We validate AdaBelief in extensive experiments, showing that it outperforms other methods with fast convergence and high accuracy on image classification and language modeling. Specifically, on ImageNet, AdaBelief achieves comparable accuracy to SGD. Furthermore, in the training of a GAN on Cifar10, AdaBelief demonstrates high stability and improves the quality of generated samples compared to a well-tuned Adam optimizer.

To address this problem, meta-learning algorithms use prior experience about tasks to learn new, related tasks efficiently. Typically, a set of training tasks is assumed given or randomly chosen. However, this setting does not take into account the sequential nature that naturally arises when training a model from scratch in real-life: how do we collect a set of training tasks in a data-efficient manner? In this work, we introduce task selection based on prior experience into a meta-learning algorithm by conceptualizing the learner and the active meta-learning setting using a probabilistic latent variable model. We provide empirical evidence that our approach improves data-efficiency when compared to strong baselines on simulated robotic experiments.

title:  Rethinking the Value of Labels for Improving Class-Imbalanced Learning
authors:  Yuzhe Yang
abstract:  Real-world data often exhibits long-tailed distributions with heavy class imbalance, posing great challenges for deep recognition models. We identify a persisting dilemma on the value of labels in the context of imbalanced learning: on the one hand, supervision from labels typically leads to better results than its unsupervised counterparts; on the other hand, heavily imbalanced data naturally incurs "label bias" in the classifier, where the decision boundary can be drastically altered by the majority classes. In this work, we systematically investigate these two facets of labels. We demonstrate, theoretically and empirically, that class-imbalanced learning can significantly benefit in both semi-supervised and self-supervised manners. Specifically, we confirm that (1) positively, imbalanced labels are valuable: given more unlabeled data, the original labels can be leveraged with the extra data to reduce label bias in a semi-supervised manner, which greatly improves the final classifier; (2) negatively however, we argue that imbalanced labels are not useful always: classifiers that are first pre-trained in a self-supervised manner consistently outperform their corresponding baselines. Extensive experiments on large-scale imbalanced datasets verify our theoretically grounded strategies, showing superior performance over previous state-of-the-arts. Our intriguing findings highlight the need to rethink the usage of imbalanced labels in realistic long-tailed tasks

title:  Elastic-InfoGAN: Unsupervised Disentangled Representation Learning in Class-Imbalanced Data
authors:  Utkarsh Ojha
abstract:  We propose a novel unsupervised generative model that learns to disentangle object identity from other low-level aspects in class-imbalanced data. We first investigate the issues surrounding the assumptions about uniformity made by InfoGAN, and demonstrate its ineffectiveness to properly disentangle object identity in imbalanced data. Our key idea is to make the discovery of the discrete latent factor of variation invariant to identity-preserving transformations in real images, and use that as a signal to learn the appropriate latent distribution representing object identity. Experiments on both artificial (MNIST, 3D cars, 3D chairs, ShapeNet) and real-world (YouTube-Faces) imbalanced datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in disentangling object identity as a latent factor of variation.

title:  See, Hear, Explore: Curiosity via Audio-Visual Association
authors:  Victoria Dean
abstract:  Exploration is one of the core challenges in reinforcement learning. A common formulation of curiosity-driven exploration uses the difference between the real future and the future predicted by a learned model. However, predicting the future is an inherently difficult task which can be ill-posed in the face of stochasticity. In this paper, we introduce an alternative form of curiosity that rewards novel associations between different senses. Our approach exploits multiple modalities to provide a stronger signal for more efficient exploration. Our method is inspired by the fact that, for humans, both sight and sound play a critical role in exploration. We present results on several Atari environments and Habitat (a photorealistic navigation simulator), showing the benefits of using an audio-visual association model for intrinsically guiding learning agents in the absence of external rewards.

title:  BlockGAN: Learning 3D Object-aware Scene Representations from Unlabelled Images 
authors:  Thu Nguyen-Phuoc
abstract:  We present BlockGAN, an image generative model that learns object-aware 3D scene representations directly from unlabelled 2D images. Current work on scene representation learning either ignores scene background or treats the whole scene as one object. Meanwhile, work that considers scene compositionality treats scene objects only as image patches or 2D layers with alpha maps. Inspired by the computer graphics pipeline, we design BlockGAN to learn to first generate 3D features of background and foreground objects, then combine them into 3D features for the wholes cene, and finally render them into realistic images. This allows BlockGAN to reason over occlusion and interaction between objects' appearance, such as shadow and lighting, and provides control over each object's 3D pose and identity, while maintaining image realism. BlockGAN is trained end-to-end, using only unlabelled single images, without the need for 3D geometry, pose labels, object masks, or multiple views of the same scene. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features to represent objects allows BlockGAN to learn disentangled representations both in terms of objects (foreground and background) and their properties (pose and identity).

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] SDF-SRN: Learning Signed Distance 3D Object Reconstruction from Static Images
authors:  chlin
abstract:  Dense 3D object reconstruction from a single image has recently witnessed remarkable advances, but supervising neural networks with ground-truth 3D shapes is impractical due to the laborious process of creating paired image-shape datasets. Recent efforts have turned to learning 3D reconstruction without 3D supervision from RGB images with annotated 2D silhouettes, dramatically reducing the cost and effort of annotation. These techniques, however, remain impractical as they still require multi-view annotations of the same object instance during training. As a result, most experimental efforts to date have been limited to synthetic datasets. In this paper, we address this issue and propose SDF-SRN, an approach that requires only a single view of objects at training time, offering greater utility for real-world scenarios. SDF-SRN learns implicit 3D shape representations to handle arbitrary shape topologies that may exist in the datasets. To this end, we derive a novel differentiable rendering formulation for learning signed distance functions (SDF) from 2D silhouettes. Our method outperforms the state of the art under challenging single-view supervision settings on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

title:  The Wasserstein Proximal Gradient Algorithm [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  Adil Salim
abstract:  Wasserstein gradient flows are continuous time dynamics that define curves of steepest descent to minimize an objective function over the space of probability measures (i.e., the Wasserstein space). This objective is typically a divergence w.r.t. a fixed target distribution. In recent years, these continuous time dynamics have been used to study the convergence of machine learning algorithms aiming at approximating a probability distribution. However, the discrete-time behavior of these algorithms might differ from the continuous time dynamics. Besides, although discretized gradient flows have been proposed in the literature, little is known about their minimization power. In this work, we propose a Forward Backward (FB) discretization scheme that can tackle the case where the objective function is the sum of a smooth and a nonsmooth geodesically convex terms. Using techniques from convex optimization and optimal transport, we analyze the FB scheme as a minimization algorithm on the Wasserstein space. More precisely, we show under mild assumptions that the FB scheme has convergence guarantees similar to the proximal gradient algorithm in Euclidean spaces (resp. similar to the associated Wasserstein gradient flow).

title:  Primal Dual Interpretation of the Proximal Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  Adil Salim
abstract:  We consider the task of sampling with respect to a log concave probability distribution. The potential of the target distribution is assumed to be composite, i.e., written as the sum of a smooth convex term, and a nonsmooth convex term possibly taking infinite values. The target distribution can be seen as a minimizer of the Kullback-Leibler divergence defined on the Wasserstein space (i.e., the space of probability measures). In the first part of this paper, we establish a strong duality result for this minimization problem. In the second part of this paper, we use the duality gap arising from the first part to study the complexity of the Proximal Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA), which can be seen as a generalization of the Projected Langevin Algorithm. Our approach relies on viewing PSGLA as a primal dual algorithm and covers many cases where the target distribution is not fully supported. In particular, we show that if the potential is strongly convex, the complexity of PSGLA is $\cO(1/\varepsilon^2)$ in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance. In contrast, the complexity of the Projected Langevin Algorithm is $\cO(1/\varepsilon^{12})$ in terms of total variation when the potential is convex.

title:  Sparse Weight Activation Training [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  aamirraihan
abstract:  Neural network training is computationally and memory intensive. Sparse training can reduce the burden on emerging hardware platforms designed to accelerate sparse computations, but it can affect network convergence. In this work, we propose a novel CNN training algorithm Sparse Weight Activation Training (SWAT). SWAT is more computation and memory-efficient than conventional training. SWAT modifies back-propagation based on the empirical insight that convergence during training tends to be robust to the elimination of (i) small magnitude weights during the forward pass and (ii) both small magnitude weights and activations during the backward pass. We evaluate SWAT on recent CNN architectures such as ResNet, VGG, DenseNet and WideResNet using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet SWAT reduces total floating-point operations (FLOPS) during training by 80% resulting in a 3.3× training speedup when run on a simulated sparse learning accelerator representative of emerging platforms while incurring only 1.63% reduction in validation accuracy. Moreover, SWAT reduces memory footprint during the backward pass by 23% to 50% for activations and 50% to 90% for weights.

title:  Learning compositional functions via multiplicative weight updates [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  Jeremy Bernstein
abstract:  Compositionality is a basic structural feature of both biological and artificial neural networks. Learning compositional functions via gradient descent incurs well known problems like vanishing and exploding gradients, making careful learning rate tuning essential for real-world applications. This paper proves that multiplicative weight updates satisfy a descent lemma tailored to compositional functions. Based on this lemma, we derive Madam---a multiplicative version of the Adam optimiser---and show that it can train state of the art neural network architectures without learning rate tuning. We further show that Madam is easily adapted to train natively compressed neural networks by representing their weights in a logarithmic number system. We conclude by drawing connections between multiplicative weight updates and recent findings about synapses in biology.

authors:  Benjamin Biggs
abstract:  We consider the problem of obtaining dense 3D reconstructions of humans from single and partially occluded views. In such cases,  the visual evidence is usually insufficient to identify a 3D reconstruction uniquely, so we aim at recovering several plausible reconstructions compatible with the input data. We suggest that ambiguities can be modelled more effectively by parametrizing the possible body shapes and poses via a suitable 3D model, such as SMPL for humans. We propose to learn a multi-hypothesis neural network regressor using a best-of-M loss, where each of the M hypotheses is constrained to lie on a manifold of plausible human poses by means of a generative model.  We show that our method outperforms alternative approaches in ambiguous pose recovery on standard benchmarks for 3D humans, and in heavily occluded versions of these benchmarks.

title:  From Trees to Continuous Embeddings and Back: Hyperbolic Hierarchical Clustering [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  ines.chami22
abstract:  Similarity-based Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is a classical unsupervised machine learning algorithm that has traditionally been solved with heuristic algorithms like Average-Linkage. Recently, Dasgupta reframed HC as a discrete optimization problem by introducing a global cost function measuring the quality of a given tree. In this work, we provide the first continuous relaxation of Dasgupta's discrete optimization problem with provable quality guarantees. The key idea of our method, HypHC, is showing a direct correspondence from discrete trees to continuous representations (via the hyperbolic embeddings of their leaf nodes) and back (via a decoding algorithm that maps leaf embeddings to a dendrogram), allowing us to search the space of discrete binary trees with continuous optimization. Building on analogies between trees and hyperbolic space, we derive a continuous analogue for the notion of lowest common ancestor, which leads to a continuous relaxation of Dasgupta's discrete objective. We can show that after decoding, the global minimizer of our continuous relaxation yields a discrete tree with a (1 + epsilon)-factor approximation for Dasgupta's optimal tree, where epsilon can be made arbitrarily small and controls optimization challenges. We experimentally evaluate HypHC on a variety of HC benchmarks and find that even approximate solutions found with gradient descent have superior clustering quality than agglomerative heuristics or other gradient based algorithms. Finally, we highlight the flexibility of HypHC using end-to-end training in a downstream classification task.

title:  GRAF: Generative Radiance Fields for 3D-Aware Image Synthesis [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  Katja Schwarz
abstract:  While 2D generative adversarial networks have enabled high-resolution image synthesis, they largely lack an understanding of the 3D world and the image formation process. Thus, they do not provide precise control over camera viewpoint or object pose. To address this problem, several recent approaches leverage intermediate voxel-based representations in combination with differentiable rendering. However, existing methods either produce low image resolution or fall short in disentangling camera and scene properties, e.g., the object identity may vary with the viewpoint. In this paper, we propose a generative model for radiance fields which have recently proven successful for novel view synthesis of a single scene. In contrast to voxel-based representations, radiance fields are not confined to a coarse discretization of the 3D space, yet allow for disentangling camera and scene properties while degrading gracefully in the presence of reconstruction ambiguity. By introducing a multi-scale patch-based discriminator, we demonstrate synthesis of high-resolution images while training our model from unposed 2D images alone. We systematically analyze our approach on several challenging synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experiments reveal that radiance fields are a powerful representation for generative image synthesis, leading to 3D consistent models that render with high fidelity.

title:  A Class of Algorithms for General Instrumental Variable Models [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  nikikilbertus
abstract:  Causal treatment effect estimation is a key problem that arises in a variety of real-world settings, from personalized medicine to governmental policy making. There has been a flurry of recent work in machine learning on estimating causal effects when one has access to an instrument. However, to achieve identifiability, they in general require one-size-fits-all assumptions such as an additive error model for the outcome. An alternative is partial identification, which provides bounds on the causal effect. Little exists in terms of bounding methods that can deal with the most general case, where the treatment itself can be continuous. Moreover, bounding methods generally do not allow for a continuum of assumptions on the shape of the causal effect that can smoothly trade off stronger background knowledge for more informative bounds. In this work, we provide a method for causal effect bounding in continuous distributions, leveraging recent advances in gradient-based methods for the optimization of computationally intractable objective functions. We demonstrate on a set of synthetic and real-world data that our bounds capture the causal effect when additive methods fail, providing a useful range of answers compatible with observation as opposed to relying on unwarranted structural assumptions.

title:  Blind Video Temporal Consistency via Deep Video Prior [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  chenyang lei
abstract:  Applying image processing algorithms independently to each video frame often leads to temporal inconsistency in the resulting video. To address this issue, we present a novel and general approach for blind video temporal consistency. Our method is only trained on a pair of original and processed videos directly instead of a large dataset. Unlike most previous methods that enforce temporal consistency with optical flow, we show that temporal consistency can be achieved by training a convolutional network on a video with the Deep Video Prior. Moreover, a carefully designed iteratively reweighted training strategy is proposed to address the challenging multimodal inconsistency problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on 7 computer vision tasks on videos. Extensive quantitative and perceptual experiments show that our approach obtains superior performance than state-of-the-art methods on blind video temporal consistency. Our source codes are publicly available at github.com/ChenyangLEI/deep-video-prior.

title:  Correlation Robust Influence Maximization [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  louischenusa
abstract:  We propose a distributionally robust model for the influence maximization problem. Unlike the classic independent cascade model \citep{kempe2003maximizing}, this model's diffusion process is adversarially adapted to the choice of seed set. Hence, instead of optimizing under the assumption that all influence relationships in the network are independent, we seek a seed set whose expected influence under the worst correlation, i.e. the "worst-case, expected influence", is maximized. We show that this worst-case influence can be efficiently computed, and though the optimization is NP-hard, a (1−1/e) approximation guarantee holds. We also analyze the structure to the adversary's choice of diffusion process, and contrast with established models. Beyond the key computational advantages, we also highlight the extent to which the independence assumption may cost optimality, and provide insights from numerical experiments comparing the adversarial and independent cascade model.

title:  [Spotlight at NeurIPS 2020] Bayesian Meta-Learning for the Few-Shot Setting via Deep Kernels 
authors:  massimiliano.patacchiola
abstract:  Recently, different machine learning methods have been introduced to tackle the challenging few-shot learning scenario that is, learning from a small labeled dataset related to a specific task. Common approaches have taken the form of meta-learning: learning to learn on the new problem given the old. Following the recognition that meta-learning is implementing learning in a multi-level model, we present a Bayesian treatment for the meta-learning inner loop through the use of deep kernels. As a result we can learn a kernel that transfers to new tasks; we call this Deep Kernel Transfer (DKT). This approach has many advantages: is straightforward to implement as a single optimizer, provides uncertainty quantification, and does not require estimation of task-specific parameters. We empirically demonstrate that DKT outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in few-shot classification, and is the state of the art for cross-domain adaptation and regression. We conclude that complex meta-learning routines can be replaced by a simpler Bayesian model without loss of accuracy.

title:  [Spotlight at NeurIPS 2020] Self-Supervised Relational Reasoning for Representation Learning
authors:  massimiliano.patacchiola
abstract:  In self-supervised learning, a system is tasked with achieving a surrogate objective by defining alternative targets on a set of unlabeled data. The aim is to build useful representations that can be used in downstream tasks, without costly manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised formulation of relational reasoning that allows a learner to bootstrap a signal from information implicit in unlabeled data. Training a relation head to discriminate how entities relate to themselves (intra-reasoning) and other entities (inter-reasoning), results in rich and descriptive representations in the underlying neural network backbone, which can be used in downstream tasks such as classification and image retrieval. We evaluate the proposed method following a rigorous experimental procedure, using standard datasets, protocols, and backbones. Self-supervised relational reasoning outperforms the best competitor in all conditions by an average 14% in accuracy, and the most recent state-of-the-art model by 3%. We link the effectiveness of the method to the maximization of a Bernoulli log-likelihood, which can be considered as a proxy for maximizing the mutual information, resulting in a more efficient objective with respect to the commonly used contrastive losses.

title:  [Spotlight at NeurIPS 2020] ShapeFlow: Learnable Deformations Among 3D Shapes
authors:  Max Jiang
abstract:  We present ShapeFlow, a flow-based model for learning a deformation space for entire classes of 3D shapes with large intra-class variations. ShapeFlow allows learning a multi-template deformation space that is agnostic to shape topology, yet preserves fine geometric details. Different from a generative space where a latent vector is directly decoded into a shape, a deformation space decodes a vector into a continuous flow that can advect a source shape towards a target. Such a space naturally allows the disentanglement of geometric style (coming from the source) and structural pose (conforming to the target). We parametrize the deformation between geometries as a learned continuous flow field via a neural network and show that such deformations can be guaranteed to have desirable properties, such as be bijectivity, freedom from self-intersections, or volume preservation. We illustrate the effectiveness of this learned deformation space for various downstream applications, including shape generation via deformation, geometric style transfer, unsupervised learning of a consistent parameterization for entire classes of shapes, and shape interpolation.

title:  A local temporal difference code for distributional reinforcement learning
authors:  Pablo Tano
abstract:  Recent theoretical and experimental results suggest that the dopamine system implements distributional temporal difference backups, allowing learning of the entire distributions of the long-run values of states rather than just their expected values. However, the distributional codes explored so far rely on a complex imputation step which crucially relies on spatial non-locality: in order to compute reward prediction errors, units must know not only their own state but also the states of the other units. It is far from clear how these steps could be implemented in realistic neural circuits. Here, we introduce the Laplace code: a local temporal difference code for distributional reinforcement learning that is representationally powerful and computationally straightforward. The code decomposes value distributions and prediction errors across three separated dimensions: reward magnitude (related to distributional quantiles), temporal discounting (related to the Laplace transform of future rewards) and time horizon (related to eligibility traces). Besides lending itself to a local learning rule, the decomposition recovers the temporal evolution of the immediate reward distribution, indicating all possible rewards at all future times. This increases representational capacity and allows for temporally-flexible computations that immediately adjust to changing horizons or discount factors.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] Swapping Autoencoder for Deep Image Manipulation
authors:  Taesung Park
abstract:  Deep generative models have become increasingly effective at producing realistic images from randomly sampled seeds, but using such models for controllable manipulation of existing images remains challenging. We propose the Swapping Autoencoder, a deep model designed specifically for image manipulation, rather than random sampling. The key idea is to encode an image with two independent components and enforce that any swapped combination maps to a realistic image. In particular, we encourage the components to represent structure and texture, by enforcing one component to encode co-occurrent patch statistics across different parts of an image. As our method is trained with an encoder, finding the latent codes for a new input image becomes trivial, rather than cumbersome. As a result, it can be used to manipulate real input images in various ways, including texture swapping, local and global editing, and latent code vector arithmetic. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our model produces better results and is substantially more efficient compared to recent generative models.

title:  Neural Unsigned Distance Fields for Implicit Function Learning (NeurIPS 2020)
authors:  Julian Chibane
abstract:  In this work we target a learnable output representation that allows continuous, high resolution outputs of arbitrary shape. Recent works represent 3D surfaces implicitly with a Neural Network, thereby breaking previous barriers in resolution, and ability to represent diverse topologies. However, neural implicit representations are limited to closed surfaces, which divide the space into inside and outside. Many real world objects such as walls of a scene scanned by a sensor, clothing, or a car with inner structures are not closed. This constitutes a significant barrier, in terms of data pre-processing (objects need to be artificially closed creating artifacts), and the ability to output open surfaces. In this work, we propose Neural Distance Fields (NDF), a neural network based model which predicts the unsigned distance field for arbitrary 3D shapes given sparse point clouds. NDF represent surfaces at high resolutions as prior implicit models, but do not require closed surface data, and significantly broaden the class of representable shapes in the output. NDF allow to extract the surface as very dense point clouds and as meshes. We also show that NDF allow for surface normal calculation and can be rendered using a slight modification of sphere tracing. We find NDF can be used for multi-target regression (multiple outputs for one input) with techniques that have been exclusively used for rendering in graphics. Experiments on ShapeNet show that NDF, while simple, is the state-of-the art, and allows to reconstruct shapes with inner structures, such as the chairs inside a bus. Notably, we show that NDF are not restricted to 3D shapes, and can approximate more general open surfaces such as curves, manifolds, and functions.

We propose a two-stage framework, which refactorizes a high-reward teacher policy into a generalizable student policy with strong inductive bias. Particularly, we implement an object-centric GNN-based student policy, whose input objects are learned from images through self-supervised learning. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on four difficult tasks that require compositional generalizability, and achieve superior performance compared to baselines.

title:  Self-paced Contrastive Learning with Hybrid Memory for Domain Adaptive Object Re-ID [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  Yixiao Ge
abstract:  Domain adaptive object re-ID aims to transfer the learned knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain to tackle the open-class re-identification problems. Although state-of-the-art pseudo-label-based methods have achieved great success, they did not make full use of all valuable information because of the domain gap and unsatisfying clustering performance. To solve these problems, we propose a novel self-paced contrastive learning framework with hybrid memory. The hybrid memory dynamically generates source-domain class-level, target-domain cluster-level and un-clustered instance-level supervisory signals for learning feature representations. Different from the conventional contrastive learning strategy, the proposed framework jointly distinguishes source-domain classes, and target-domain clusters and un-clustered instances. Most importantly, the proposed self-paced method gradually creates more reliable clusters to refine the hybrid memory and learning targets, and is shown to be the key to our outstanding performance. Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple domain adaptation tasks of object re-ID and even boosts the performance on the source domain without any extra annotations. Our generalized version on unsupervised object re-ID surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by considerable 16.7% and 7.9% on Market-1501 and MSMT17 benchmarks.

title:  A Boolean Task Algebra for Reinforcement Learning [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  Geraud Nangue Tasse
abstract:  The ability to compose learned skills to solve new tasks is an important property of lifelong-learning agents. In this work, we formalise the logical composition of tasks as a Boolean algebra. This allows us to formulate new tasks in terms of the negation, disjunction and conjunction of a set of base tasks. We then show that by learning goal-oriented value functions and restricting the transition dynamics of the tasks, an agent can solve these new tasks with no further learning. We prove that by composing these value functions in specific ways, we immediately recover the optimal policies for all tasks expressible under the Boolean algebra. We verify our approach in two domains---including a high-dimensional video game environment requiring function approximation---where an agent first learns a set of base skills, and then composes them to solve a super-exponential number of new tasks.

title:  COBE: Contextualized Object Embeddings from Narrated Instructional Video [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  gedas
abstract:  Many objects in the real world undergo dramatic variations in visual appearance. For example, a tomato may be red or green, sliced or chopped, fresh or fried, liquid or solid. Training a single detector to accurately recognize tomatoes in all these different states is challenging. On the other hand, contextual cues (e.g., the presence of a knife, a cutting board, a strainer or a pan) are often strongly indicative of how the object appears in the scene. Recognizing such contextual cues is useful not only to improve the accuracy of object detection or to determine the state of the object, but also to understand its functional properties and to infer ongoing or upcoming human-object interactions. A fully-supervised approach to recognizing object states and their contexts in the real-world is unfortunately marred by the long-tailed, open-ended distribution of the data, which would effectively require massive amounts of annotations to capture the appearance of objects in all their different forms. Instead of relying on manually-labeled data for this task, we propose a new framework for learning Contextualized OBject Embeddings (COBE) from automatically-transcribed narrations of instructional videos. We leverage the semantic and compositional structure of language by training a visual detector to predict a contextualized word embedding of the object and its associated narration. This enables the learning of an object representation where concepts relate according to a semantic language metric. Our experiments show that our detector learns to predict a rich variety of contextual object information, and that it is highly effective in the settings of few-shot and zero-shot learning.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] Joint Policy Search for Multi-agent Collaboration with Imperfect Information
authors:  Yuandong Tian
abstract:  To learn good joint policies for multi-agent collaboration with imperfect information remains a fundamental challenge. While for two-player zero-sum games, coordinate-ascent approaches (optimizing one agent's policy at a time, e.g., self-play) work with guarantees, in multi-agent cooperative setting they often converge to sub-optimal Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, directly modeling joint policy changes in imperfect information game is nontrivial due to complicated interplay of policies (e.g., upstream updates affect downstream state reachability). In this paper, we show global changes of game values can be decomposed to policy changes localized at each information set, with a novel term named policy-change density. Based on this, we propose Joint Policy Search(JPS) that iteratively improves joint policies of collaborative agents in imperfect information games, without re-evaluating the entire game. On multi-agent collaborative tabular games, JPS is proven to never worsen performance and can improve solutions provided by unilateral approaches (e.g, CFR), outperforming algorithms designed for collaborative policy learning (e.g. BAD). Furthermore, for real-world games, JPS has an online form that naturally links with gradient updates. We test it to Contract Bridge, a 4-player imperfect-information game where a team of 2 collaborates to compete against the other. In its bidding phase, players bid in turn to find a good contract through a limited information channel. Based on a strong baseline agent that bids competitive bridge purely through domain-agnostic self-play, JPS improves collaboration of team players and outperforms WBridge5, a championship-winning software, by +0.63 IMPs (International Matching Points) per board over 1k games, substantially better than previous SoTA (+0.41 IMPs/b) under Double-Dummy evaluation.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020] Residual Force Control for Agile Human Behavior Imitation and Extended Motion Synthesis
authors:  Ye Yuan
abstract:  Reinforcement learning has shown great promise for synthesizing realistic human behaviors by learning humanoid control policies from motion capture data. However, it is still very challenging to reproduce sophisticated human skills like ballet dance, or to stably imitate long-term human behaviors with complex transitions. The main difficulty lies in the dynamics mismatch between the humanoid model and real humans. That is, motions of real humans may not be physically possible for the humanoid model. To overcome the dynamics mismatch, we propose a novel approach, residual force control (RFC), that augments a humanoid control policy by adding external residual forces into the action space. During training, the RFC-based policy learns to apply residual forces to the humanoid to compensate for the dynamics mismatch and better imitate the reference motion. Experiments on a wide range of dynamic motions demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence speed and the quality of learned motions. For the first time, we show a physics-based virtual character performing highly agile ballet dance moves such as pirouette, arabesque and jeté. Furthermore, we propose a dual-policy control framework, where a kinematic policy and an RFC-based policy work in tandem to synthesize multi-modal infinite-horizon human motions without any task guidance or user input. Our approach is the first humanoid control method that successfully learns from a large-scale human motion dataset (Human3.6M) and generates diverse long-term motions.

title:  Simulating a Primary Visual Cortex at the Front of CNNs Improves Robustness to Image Perturbations
authors:  MITCBMM
abstract:  Current state-of-the-art object recognition models are largely based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, which are loosely inspired by the primate visual system. However, these CNNs can be fooled by imperceptibly small, explicitly crafted perturbations, and struggle to recognize objects in corrupted images that are easily recognized by humans. Here, by making comparisons with primate neural data, we first observed that CNN models with a neural hidden layer that better matches primate primary visual cortex (V1) are also more robust to adversarial attacks. Inspired by this observation, we developed VOneNets, a new class of hybrid CNN vision models. Each VOneNet contains a fixed weight neural network front-end that simulates primate V1, called the VOneBlock, followed by a neural network back-end adapted from current CNN vision models. The VOneBlock is based on a classical neuroscientific model of V1: the linear-nonlinear-Poisson model, consisting of a biologically-constrained Gabor filter bank, simple and complex cell nonlinearities, and a V1 neuronal stochasticity generator. After training, VOneNets retain high ImageNet performance, but each is substantially more robust, outperforming the base CNNs and state-of-the-art methods by 18% and 3%, respectively, on a conglomerate benchmark of perturbations comprised of white box adversarial attacks and common image corruptions. Finally, we show that all components of the VOneBlock work in synergy to improve robustness. While current CNN architectures are arguably brain-inspired, the results presented here demonstrate that more precisely mimicking just one stage of the primate visual system leads to new gains in ImageNet-level computer vision applications.

title:  Crush Optimism with Pessimism: Structured Bandits Beyond Asymptotic Optimality (NeurIPS 2020 Paper)
authors:  Kwang-Sung Jun
abstract:  We study stochastic structured bandits for minimizing regret. The fact that the popular optimistic algorithms do not achieve the asymptotic instance-dependent regret optimality (asymptotic optimality for short) has recently alluded researchers. On the other hand, it is known that one can achieve bounded regret (i.e., does not grow indefinitely with n) in certain instances. Unfortunately, existing asymptotically optimal algorithms rely on forced sampling that introduces an ω(1) term w.r.t. the time horizon n in their regret, failing to adapt to the "easiness" of the instance. In this paper, we focus on the finite hypothesis case and ask if one can achieve the asymptotic optimality while enjoying bounded regret whenever possible. We provide a positive answer by introducing a new algorithm called CRush Optimism with Pessimism (CROP) that eliminates optimistic hypotheses by pulling the informative arms indicated by a pessimistic hypothesis. Our finite-time analysis shows that CROP (i) achieves a constant-factor asymptotic optimality and, thanks to the forced-exploration-free design, (ii) adapts to bounded regret, and (iii) its regret bound scales not with K but with an effective number of arms Kψ that we introduce. We also discuss a problem class where CROP can be exponentially better than existing algorithms in \textit{nonasymptotic} regimes. This problem class also reveals a surprising fact that even a clairvoyant oracle who plays according to the asymptotically optimal arm pull scheme may suffer a linear worst-case regret.

title:  Co-exposure Maximization in Online Social Networks [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  Sijing Tu
abstract:  Social media has created new ways for citizens to stay informed on societal matters and participate in political discourse. However, with its algorithmically-curated and virally-propagating content, social media has contributed further to the polarization of opinions by reinforcing users' existing viewpoints. An emerging line of research seeks to understand how content-recommendation algorithms can be re-designed to mitigate societal polarization amplified by social-media interactions. In this paper, we study the problem of allocating seed users to opposing campaigns: by drawing on the equal-time rule of political campaigning on traditional media, our goal is to allocate seed users to campaigners with the aim to maximize the expected number of users who are co-exposed to both campaigns.

title:  A Loss Function for Generative Neural Networks Based on Watson's Perceptual Model [NeurIPS 2020]
authors:  Steffen Czolbe
abstract:  To train Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate realistic imagery requires a loss function that reflects human perception of image similarity. We propose such a loss function based on Watson's perceptual model, which computes a weighted distance in frequency space and accounts for luminance and contrast masking. We extend the model to color images, increase its robustness to translation by using the Fourier Transform, remove artifacts due to splitting the image into blocks, and make it differentiable. In experiments, VAEs trained with the new loss function generated realistic, high-quality image samples. Compared to using the Euclidean distance and the Structural Similarity Index, the images were less blurry; compared to deep neural network based losses, the new approach required less computational resources and generated images with less artifacts.

authors:  Karush Suri
abstract:  s exploration from exploitation by combining Evolution Strategies (ES) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), (2) provides dominant skill transfer between offsprings by making use of soft winner selections and genetic crossovers in hindsight and (3) improves hyperparameter sensitivity in evolutions using Automatic Mutation Tuning (AMT). AMT gradually replaces the entropy framework of SAC allowing the population to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible, without making use of backpropagation updates. On a range of challenging control tasks consisting of high-dimensional action spaces and sparse rewards, ESAC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and sample efficiency equivalent to SAC. ESAC demonstrates scalability comparable to ES on the basis of hardware resources and algorithm overhead.

title:  [NeurIPS 2020 3-min talk] DeepSVG: A Hierarchical Generative Network for Vector Graphics Animation 
authors:  Alexandre Carlier
abstract:  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are ubiquitous in modern 2D interfaces due to their ability to scale to different resolutions. However, despite the success of deep learning-based models applied to rasterized images, the problem of vector graphics representation learning and generation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical generative network, called DeepSVG, for complex SVG icons generation and interpolation. Our architecture effectively disentangles high-level shapes from the low-level commands that encode the shape itself. The network directly predicts a set of shapes in a non-autoregressive fashion. We introduce the task of complex SVG icons generation by releasing a new large-scale dataset along with an open-source library for SVG manipulation. We demonstrate that our network learns to accurately reconstruct diverse vector graphics, and can serve as a powerful animation tool by performing interpolations and other latent space operations.

We investigate the use of a truncated least squares (TLS) cost function, which is known to be robust to outliers, but leads to hard, nonconvex, and nonsmooth optimization problems. Our first contribution is to show that -for a broad class of geometric perception problems- TLS estimation can be reformulated as an optimization over the ring of polynomials and Lasserre's hierarchy of convex moment relaxations is empirically tight at the minimum relaxation order (i.e., certifiably obtains the global minimum of the nonconvex TLS problem). Our second contribution is to exploit the structural sparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and leverage basis reduction to significantly reduce the size of the semidefinite program (SDP) resulting from the moment relaxation, without compromising its tightness. Our third contribution is to develop scalable dual optimality certifiers from the lens of sums-of-squares (SOS) relaxation, that can compute the suboptimality gap and possibly certify global optimality of any candidate solution (e.g., returned by fast heuristics such as RANSAC or graduated non-convexity). Our dual certifiers leverage Douglas-Rachford Splitting to solve a convex feasibility SDP. Numerical experiments across different perception problems, including single rotation averaging, shape alignment, 3D point cloud and mesh registration, and high-integrity satellite pose estimation, demonstrate the tightness of our relaxations, the correctness of the certification, and the scalability of the proposed dual certifiers to large problems, beyond the reach of current SDP solvers.

title:  Cross-modal Hierarchical Modelling for Fine-Grained Sketch Based Image Retrieval
authors:  Aneeshan Sain
abstract:  Sketch as an image search query is an ideal alternative to text in capturing the fine-grained visual details. Prior successes on fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) have demonstrated the importance of tackling the unique traits of sketches as opposed to photos, e.g., temporal vs. static, strokes vs. pixels, and vs. pixel-perfect. In this paper, we study a further trait of sketches that has been overlooked to date, that is, they are hierarchical in terms of the levels of detail -- a person typically sketches up to various extents of detail to depict an object. This hierarchical structure is often visually distinct. In this paper, we design a novel network that is capable of cultivating sketch-specific hierarchies and exploiting them to match sketch with photo at corresponding hierarchical levels. In particular, features from a sketch and a photo are enriched using cross-modal co-attention, coupled with hierarchical node fusion at every level to form a better embedding space to conduct retrieval. Experiments on common benchmarks show our method to outperform state-of-the-arts by a significant margin.

title:  First-Person View Hand Segmentation of Multi-Modal Hand Activity Video Dataset
authors:  CdesignLab
abstract:  First-person-view videos of hands interacting with tools are widely used in the computer vision industry. However, creating a dataset with pixel-wise segmentation of hands is challenging since most videos are captured with fingertips occluded by the hand dorsum and grasped tools. Current methods often rely on manually segmenting hands to create annotations, which is inefficient and costly. To relieve this challenge, we create a method that utilizes thermal information of hands for efficient pixel-wise hand segmentation to create a multi-modal activity video dataset. Our method is not affected by fingertip and joint occlusions and does not require hand pose ground truth. We show our method to be 24 times faster than the traditional polygon labeling method while maintaining high quality. With the segmentation method, we propose a multi-modal hand activity video dataset with 790 sequences and 401,765 frames of “hands using tools” videos captured by thermal and RGB-D cameras with hand segmentation data. We analyze multiple models for hand segmentation performance and benchmark four segmentation networks. We show that our multi-modal dataset with fusing LWIR and RGB-D frames achieves 5% better hand IoU performance than using RGB frames.

title:  A Better Use of Audio-Visual Cues: Dense Video Captioning with Bi-modal Transformer
authors:  Vladimir Iashin
abstract:  Dense video captioning aims to localize and describe important events in untrimmed videos. Existing methods mainly tackle this task by exploiting only visual features, while completely neglecting the audio track. Only a few prior works have utilized both modalities, yet they show poor results or demonstrate the importance on a dataset with a specific domain. In this paper, we introduce Bi-modal Transformer which generalizes the Transformer architecture for a bi-modal input. We show the effectiveness of the proposed model with audio and visual modalities on the dense video captioning task, yet the module is capable of digesting any two modalities in a sequence-to-sequence task. We also show that the pre-trained bi-modal encoder as a part of the bi-modal transformer can be used as a feature extractor for a simple proposal generation module. The performance is demonstrated on a challenging ActivityNet Captions dataset where our model achieves outstanding performance.

title:  Making a Case for 3D Convolutions for Object Segmentation in Videos (BMVC'20)
authors:  RWTHVision
abstract:  The task of object segmentation in videos is usually accomplished by processing appearance and motion information separately using standard 2D convolutional networks, followed by a learned fusion of the two sources of information. On the other hand, 3D convolutional networks have been successfully applied for video classification tasks, but have not been leveraged as effectively to problems involving dense per-pixel interpretation of videos compared to their 2D convolutional counterparts and lag behind the aforementioned networks in terms of performance. In this work, we show that 3D CNNs can be effectively applied to dense video prediction tasks such as salient object segmentation. We propose a simple yet effective encoder-decoder network architecture consisting entirely of 3D convolutions that can be trained end-to-end using a standard cross-entropy loss. To this end, we leverage an efficient 3D encoder, and propose a 3D decoder architecture, that comprises novel 3D Global Convolution layers and 3D Refinement modules. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-arts by a large margin on the DAVIS'16 Unsupervised, FBMS and ViSal dataset benchmarks in addition to being faster, thus showing that our architecture can efficiently learn expressive spatio-temporal features and produce high quality video segmentation masks.

title:  Uncovering Hidden Challenges in Query-Based Video Moment Retrieval (BMVC 2020)
authors:  AI techstudio
abstract:  The query-based moment retrieval is a problem of localising a specific clip from an untrimmed video according a query sentence. This is a challenging task that requires interpretation of both the natural language query and the video content. Like in many other areas in computer vision and machine learning, the progress in query-based moment retrieval is heavily driven by the benchmark datasets and, therefore, their quality has significant impact on the field. In this paper, we present a series of experiments assessing how well the benchmark results reflect the true progress in solving the moment retrieval task. Our results indicate substantial biases in the popular datasets and unexpected behaviour of the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we present new sanity check experiments and approaches for visualising the results. Finally, we suggest possible directions to improve the temporal sentence grounding in the future.

title:  [BMVC 2020] ViewSynth - Learning Local Features from Depth using View Synthesis
authors:  Jisan Mahmud
abstract:  The rapid development of inexpensive commodity depth sensors has made keypoint detection and matching in the depth image modality an important problem in computer vision. Despite great improvements in recent RGB local feature learning methods, adapting them directly in the depth modality leads to unsatisfactory performance. Most of these methods do not explicitly reason beyond the visible pixels in the images. To address the limitations of these methods, we propose a framework ViewSynth, to jointly learn: (1) viewpoint invariant keypoint-descriptor from depth images using a proposed Contrastive Matching Loss, and (2) view synthesis of depth images from different viewpoints using the proposed View Synthesis Module and View Synthesis Loss. By learning view synthesis, we explicitly encourage the feature extractor to encode information about not only the visible, but also the occluded parts of the scene. We demonstrate that in the depth modality, ViewSynth outperforms the state-of-the-art depth and RGB local feature extraction techniques in the 3D keypoint matching and camera localization tasks on the RGB-D datasets 7-Scenes, TUM RGBD and CoRBS in most scenarios. We also show the generalizability of ViewSynth in 3D keypoint matching across different datasets.

authors:  Zirui Ryan Wang
abstract:  We introduce a novel self-attention-based normal estimation network that is able to focus softly on relevant points and adjust the softness by learning a temperature parameter, making it able to work naturally and effectively within a large neighbourhood range. As a result, our model outperforms all existing normal estimation algorithms by a large margin, achieving 94.1% accuracy in comparison with the previous state of the art of 91.2%, with a 25x smaller model and 12x faster inference time. We also use point-to-plane Iterative Closest Point (ICP) as an application case to show that our normal estimations lead to faster convergence than normal estimations from other methods, without manually fine-tuning neighbourhood range parameters.

title:  How to Train Your Energy-Based Model for Regression | BMVC 2020 | 1.5 min Video
authors:  Fredrik Gustafsson
abstract:  Energy-based models (EBMs) have become increasingly popular within computer vision in recent years. While they are commonly employed for generative image modeling, recent work has applied EBMs also for regression tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on object detection and visual tracking. Training EBMs is however known to be challenging. While a variety of different techniques have been explored for generative modeling, the application of EBMs to regression is not a well-studied problem. How EBMs should be trained for best possible regression performance is thus currently unclear. We therefore accept the task of providing the first detailed study of this problem. To that end, we propose a simple yet highly effective extension of noise contrastive estimation, and carefully compare its performance to six popular methods from literature on the tasks of 1D regression and object detection. The results of this comparison suggest that our training method should be considered the go-to approach. We also apply our method to the visual tracking task, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five datasets. Notably, our tracker achieves 63.7% AUC on LaSOT and 78.7% Success on TrackingNet.

title:  Delving Deeper into Anti-aliasing in ConvNets [oral presentation in BMVC 2020]
authors:  Xueyan Zou
abstract:  Aliasing refers to the phenomenon that high frequency signals degenerate into completely different ones after sampling. It arises as a problem in the context of deep learning as downsampling layers are widely adopted in deep architectures to reduce parameters and computation. The standard solution is to apply a low-pass filter (e.g., Gaussian blur) before downsampling. However, it can be suboptimal to apply the same filter across the entire content, as the frequency of feature maps can vary across both spatial locations and feature channels. To tackle this, we propose an adaptive content-aware low-pass filtering layer, which predicts separate filter weights for each spatial location and channel group of the input feature maps. We investigate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method across multiple tasks including ImageNet classification, COCO instance segmentation, and Cityscapes semantic segmentation. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our approach effectively adapts to the different feature frequencies to avoid aliasing while preserving useful information for recognition.

title:  ALBA: Reinforcement Learning for VOS (BMVC 2020)
authors:  Shreyank Gowda
abstract:  We consider the challenging problem of zero-shot video object segmentation (VOS). That is, segmenting and tracking multiple moving objects within a video fully automatically, without any manual initialization. We treat this as a grouping problem by exploiting object proposals and making a joint inference about grouping over both space and time. We propose a network architecture for tractably performing proposal selection and joint grouping. Crucially, we then show how to train this network with reinforcement learning so that it learns to perform the optimal non-myopic sequence of grouping decisions to segment the whole video. Unlike standard supervised techniques, this also enables us to directly optimize for the non-differentiable overlap-based metrics used to evaluate VOS. We show that the proposed method, which we call ALBA outperforms the previous stateof-the-art on three benchmarks: DAVIS 2017 [2], FBMS [20] and Youtube-VOS [27].

title:  [BMVC 2020] When Humans Meet Machines: Towards Efficient Segmentation Networks
authors:  Peike Li
abstract:  In this paper, we investigate how to achieve a high-performance yet lightweight segmentation network for real-time applications. By analyzing three typical segmentation networks, we observe that the segmentation backbones and heads are often imbalanced which restricts network efficiency. Thus, we develop a lightweight context fusion (LCF) module and a lightweight global enhancement (LGE) module to construct our lightweight segmentation head. Specifically, LCF fuses multi-resolution features to capture image details and LGE is designed to enhance feature representations. In this manner, our lightweight head facilities network efficiency and significantly reduces network parameters. Furthermore, we design a Multi-Resolution Macro Segmentation structure (MRMS) to incorporate human knowledge into our network architecture composition. Given the resource-aware constraint (e.g., latency time), we optimize our network with network architecture search while considering the relationships among atomic operators, network depth and feature resolution in segmentation tasks. Since MRMS embeds the segmentation-specific knowledge, it also provides a better architecture search space. Our Human-Machine collaboratively designed Segmentation network (HMSeg) achieves better performance and faster inference speed. Experiments demonstrate that our network achieves 71.4% mean intersection over union (mIOU) on Cityscapes dataset with only 0.7M parameters at 172.4 FPS on NVIDIA GTX1080Ti.

title:  Cola-GNN: Cross-location Attention based Graph Neural Networks for Long-term ILI Prediction
authors:  Songgaojun Deng
abstract:  Forecasting influenza-like illness (ILI) is of prime importance to epidemiologists and health-care providers. Early prediction of epidemic outbreaks plays a pivotal role in disease intervention and control. Most existing work has either limited long-term prediction performance or lacks a comprehensive ability to capture spatio-temporal dependencies in data. Accurate and early disease forecasting models would markedly improve both epidemic prevention and managing the onset of an epidemic. In this paper, we design a cross-location attention based graph neural network (Cola-GNN) for learning time series embeddings and location aware attentions. We propose a graph message passing framework to combine learned feature embeddings and an attention matrix to model disease propagation over time. We compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art statistical approaches and deep learning models on real-world epidemic-related datasets from United States and Japan. The proposed method shows strong predictive performance and leads to interpretable results for long-term epidemic predictions.

However, bringing concepts and BOW together into a transparent IR framework is challenging. We propose a new aggregation parameter to combine conceptual and term-based Dirichlet Compound Model scores effectively. The determination of this linear parameter is the result of exploring to what degree the difference of the conceptual and term-based sum of IDFs is influential to the integration. Instead of employing heuristics to find combined models, this paper aims to build the grounds for establishing reasonable aggregation standards based on semantic query performance predictors.

title:  Quaternion-based self-Attentive Long Short-term User Preference Encoding for Recommendation
authors:  Thanh Tran
abstract:  Quaternion space has brought several benefits over the traditional Euclidean space: Quaternions (i) consist of a real and three imaginary components, encouraging richer representations; (ii) utilize Hamilton product which better encodes the inter-latent interactions across multiple Quaternion components; and (iii) result in a model with smaller degrees of freedom and less prone to overfitting. Unfortunately, most of the current recommender systems rely on real-valued representations in Euclidean space to model either user's long-term or short-term interests. In this paper, we fully utilize Quaternion space to model both user's long-term and short-term preferences. We first propose a QUaternion-based self-Attentive Long term user Encoding (QUALE) to study the user's long-term intents. Then, we propose a QUaternion-based self-Attentive Short term user Encoding (QUASE) to learn the user's short-term interests. To enhance our models' capability, we propose to fuse QUALE and QUASE into one model, namely QUALSE, by using a Quaternion-based gating mechanism. We further develop Quaternion-based Adversarial learning along with the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (QABPR) to improve our model's robustness. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that our fused QUALSE model outperformed 11 state-of-the-art baselines, improving 8.43% at HIT@1 and 10.27% at NDCG@1 on average compared with the best baseline.

title:  [CIKM 2020] Improving Anchor-based Explanations
authors:  julien.delaunay
abstract:  Rule-based explanations are a popular method to understand the rationale behind the answers of complex machine learning (ML) classifiers. Recent approaches, such as Anchors, focus on local explanations based on if-then rules that are applicable in the vicinity of a target instance. This has proved effective at producing faithful explanations, yet anchor-based explanations are not free of limitations. These include long overly specific rules as well as explanations of low fidelity. This work presents two simple methods that can mitigate such issues on tabular and textual data. The first approach proposes a careful selection of the discretization method for numerical attributes in tabular datasets. The second one applies the notion of pertinent negatives to explanations on textual data. Our experimental evaluation shows the positive impact of such methods on the quality of anchor-based explanations.

title:  Explainable Recommender Systems via Resolving Learning Representations
authors:  Ninghao Liu
abstract:  Recommender systems play a fundamental role in web applications in filtering massive information and matching user interests. While many efforts have been devoted to developing more effective models in various scenarios, the exploration on the explainability of recommender systems is running behind. Explanations could help improve user experience and discover system defects. In this paper, after formally introducing the elements that are related to model explainability, we propose a novel explainable recommendation model through improving the transparency of the representation learning process. Specifically, to overcome the representation entangling problem in traditional models, we revise traditional graph convolution to discriminate information from different layers. Also, each representation vector is factorized into several segments, where each segment relates to one semantic aspect in data. Different from previous work, in our model, factor discovery and representation learning are simultaneously conducted, and we are able to handle extra attribute information and knowledge. In this way, the proposed model can learn interpretable and meaningful representations for users and items. Unlike traditional methods that need to make a trade-off between explainability and effectiveness, the performance of our proposed explainable model is not negatively affected after considering explainability. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of our model as well as explanation faithfulness.

title:  Detection of Novel Social Bots by Ensembles of Specialized Classifiers
authors:  Mohsen Sayyadiharikandeh
abstract:  Malicious actors create inauthentic social media accounts controlled in part by algorithms, known as social bots, to disseminate misinformation and agitate online discussion. While researchers have developed sophisticated methods to detect abuse, novel bots with diverse behaviors evade detection. We show that different types of bots are characterized by different behavioral features. As a result, supervised learning techniques suffer severe performance deterioration when attempting to detect behaviors not observed in the training data. Moreover, tuning these models to recognize novel bots requires retraining with a significant amount of new annotations, which are expensive to obtain. To address these issues, we propose a new supervised learning method that trains classifiers specialized for each class of bots and combines their decisions through the maximum rule. The ensemble of specialized classifiers (ESC) can better generalize, leading to an average improvement of 56\% in F1 score for unseen accounts across datasets. Furthermore, novel bot behaviors are learned with fewer labeled examples during retraining. We deployed ESC in the newest version of Botometer, a popular tool to detect social bots in the wild, with a cross-validation AUC of 0.99.

title:  Exploiting Common Neighbor Graph for Link Prediction
authors:  Hao Tian
abstract:  Link prediction aims to predict whether two nodes in a network are likely to get connected. Motivated by its applications, e.g., in friend or product recommendation, link prediction has been extensively studied over the years. Most link prediction methods are designed based on specific assumptions that may or may not hold in different networks, leading to link prediction methods that are not generalizable. Here, we address this problem by proposing general link prediction methods that can capture network-specific patterns. Most link prediction methods rely on computing similarities between between nodes. By learning a γ-decaying model, the proposed methods can measure the pairwise similarities between nodes more accurately, even when only using common neighbor information, which is often used by current techniques.

title:  Retrievability based Doc Selection for Relevance Feedback with Automatically Generated Qry Variants
authors:  Anirban Chakraborty
abstract:  To mitigate the problem of over-dependence of a pseudo-relevance feedback algorithm on the top-'M' document set, we make use of a set of equivalence classes of queries rather than one single query. These query equivalents are automatically constructed either from a) a knowledge base of prior distributions of terms with respect to the given query terms, or b) iteratively generated from a relevance model of term distributions in the absence of such priors. These query variants are then used to estimate the retrievability of each document with the hypothesis that documents that are more likely to be retrieved at top-ranks for a larger number of these query variants are more likely to be effective for relevance feedback. Results of our experiments show that our proposed method is able to achieve substantially better precision at top-ranks (e.g. higher nDCG@5 and P@5 values) for ad-hoc IR and points-of-interest (POI) recommendation tasks.

title:  A methodology based on Deep Q-Learning/Genetic Algorithms for optimizing COVID-19 pandemic government actions 
authors:  Luis Miralles-Pechuán
abstract:  Whenever countries are threatened by a pandemic, as is the case with the COVID-19 virus, governments should take the right actions to safeguard public health as well as to mitigate the negative effects on the economy. In this regard, there are two completely different approaches governments can take: a restrictive one, in which drastic measures such as self-isolation can seriously damage the economy, and a more liberal one, where more relaxed restrictions may put at risk a high percentage of the population. The optimal approach could be somewhere in between, and, in order to make the right decisions, it is necessary to accurately estimate the future effects of taking one or other measures. In this paper, we use the SEIR epidemiological model (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered) for infectious diseases to represent the evolution of the virus COVID-19 over time in the population. To optimize the best sequences of actions governments can take, we propose a methodology with two approaches, one based on Deep Q-Learning and another one based on Genetic Algorithms. The sequences of actions (confinement, self-isolation, two-meter distance or not taking restrictions) are evaluated according to a reward system focused on meeting two objectives: firstly, getting few people infected so that hospitals are not overwhelmed with critical patients, and secondly, avoiding taking drastic measures for too long which can potentially cause serious damage to the economy. The conducted experiments prove that our methodology is a valid tool to discover actions governments can take to reduce the negative effects of a pandemic in both senses. We also prove that the approach based on Deep Q-Learning overcomes the one based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the sequences of actions.

title:  GeoFlink: A Distributed and Scalable Framework for the Real-time Processing of Spatial Streams
authors:  Salman Ahmed Shaikh
abstract:  Apache Flink is an open-source system for scalable processing of batch and streaming data. Flink does not natively support efficient processing of spatial data streams, which is a requirement of many applications dealing with spatial data. Besides Flink, other scalable spatial data processing platforms including GeoSpark, Spatial Hadoop, etc. do not support streaming workloads and can only handle static/batch workloads. To fill this gap, we present GeoFlink, which extends Apache Flink to support spatial data types, indexes and continuous queries over spatial data streams. To enable the efficient processing of spatial continuous queries and for the effective data distribution across Flink cluster nodes, a gird-based index is introduced. GeoFlink currently supports spatial range, spatial kNN and spatial join queries on point data type. An extensive experimental study on real spatial data streams shows that GeoFlink achieves significantly higher query throughput than ordinary Flink processing.

title:  Quality-Aware Ranking of Arguments
authors:  Lorik Dumani
abstract:  Argument search engines identify, extract, and rank the most important arguments for and against a given controversial topic. A number of such systems have recently been developed, usually focusing on classic information retrieval ranking methods that are based on frequency information. An important aspect that has been ignored so far by search engines is the quality of arguments. We present a quality-aware ranking framework for arguments already extracted from texts and represented as argument graphs, considering multiple established quality measures. An extensive evaluation with a standard benchmark collection demonstrates that taking quality into account significantly helps to improve retrieval quality for argument search. We also publish a dataset in which arguments with respect to topics were tediously annotated by humans with three widely accepted argument quality dimensions.

title:  Calibration of Google Trends Data
authors:  Robert West
abstract:  Google Trends is a tool that allows researchers to analyze the popularity of Google search queries across time and space. In a single request, users can obtain time series for up to 5 queries on a common scale, normalized to the range from 0 to 100 and rounded to integer precision. Despite the overall value of Google Trends, rounding causes major problems, to the extent that entirely uninformative, all-zero time series may be returned for unpopular queries when requested together with more popular queries. We address this issue by proposing Google Trends Anchor Bank (G-TAB), an efficient solution for the calibration of Google Trends data. Our method expresses the popularity of an arbitrary number of queries on a common scale without being compromised by rounding errors. The method proceeds in two phases. In the offline preprocessing phase, an "anchor bank" is constructed, a set of queries spanning the full spectrum of popularity, all calibrated against a common reference query by carefully chaining together multiple Google Trends requests. In the online deployment phase, any given search query is calibrated by performing an efficient binary search in the anchor bank. Each search step requires one Google Trends request, but few steps suffice, as we demonstrate in an empirical evaluation.

title:  AURORA: An Information Extraction > System of Domain-specific Business Documents with Limited Data
authors:  Minh-Tien Nguyen 
abstract:  Information extraction is a well-known topic that plays a critical role in many NLP applications as its outputs can be considered as an entrance step for digital transformation. However, there still exist gaps when applying research results to actual business cases. This paper introduces AURORA, an information extraction for domain-specific business documents. The intuition of AURORA is to use transfer learning for extraction. To do that, it utilizes the power of transformers for dealing with the limitation of training data in business cases and stacks additional layers for domain adaptation. We demonstrate AURORA in the context of actual scenarios where users are invited to experience two functions: fine-grained and whole paragraph extraction of Japanese business documents. A video of the system is available at http://y2u.be/xHQpYE41Tqw.

title:  Social Factors in Closed-Network Content Consumption
authors:  Parisa  Kaghazgaran 
abstract:  How do users on social platforms consume content shared by their friends? Is this consumption socially motivated, and can we predict it? Considerable prior work has focused on inferring and learning user preferences with respect to broadcasted, or open-network content in public spheres like webpages or public videos. However, user engagement with narrowcasted, closed-network content shared by their friends is considerably under-explored, despite being a commonplace activity. Here we bridge this gap by focusing on consumption of visual media content in closed-network settings, using data from Snapchat, a large multimedia-driven social sharing service with over 200M daily active users. Broadly, we answer questions around content consumption patterns, social factors that are associated with such consumption habits, and predictability of consumption time. We propose models for patterns in users' time-spending behaviors across friends, and observe that viewers preferentially and consistently spend more time on content from certain friends, even without considering any explicit notion of intrinsic content value. We also find that consumption time is highly correlated with several engagement-based social factors, suggesting a large social role in closed-network content consumption. Finally, we propose a novel approach of modeling future consumption time as a learning-to-rank task over users? friends. Our results demonstrate significant predictive value (0.815 P@1, 0.650 nDCG@10) using only social factors. We expect our work to motivate additional research in modeling consumption and ranking of online closed-network content.

title:  Efficient Knowledge Graph Validation via Cross-Graph Representation Learning 
authors:  Yaqing Wang
abstract:  Recent advances in information extraction have motivated the automatic construction of huge Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by mining from large-scale text corpus. However, noisy facts are unavoidably introduced into KGs that could be caused by automatic extraction. To validate the correctness of facts (i.e., triplets) inside a KG, one possible approach is to map the triplets into vector representations by capturing the semantic meanings of facts. Although many representation learning approaches have been developed for knowledge graphs, these methods are not effective for validation. They usually assume that facts are correct, and thus may overfit noisy facts and fail to detect such facts. Towards effective KG validation, we propose to leverage an external human-curated KG as auxiliary information source to help detect the errors in a target KG. The external KG is built upon human-curated knowledge repositories and tends to have high precision. On the other hand, although the target KG built by information extraction from texts has low precision, it can cover new or domain-specific facts that are not in any human-curated repositories. To tackle this challenging task, we propose a cross-graph representation learning framework, i.e., CrossVal, which can leverage an external KG to validate the facts in the target KG efficiently. This is achieved by embedding triplets based on their semantic meanings, drawing cross-KG negative samples and estimating a confidence score for each triplet based on its degree of correctness. We evaluate the proposed framework on datasets across different domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale KGs.

abstract:  Signed networks are mathematical structures that encode positive and negative relations between entities such as friend/foe or trust/distrust. Recently, several papers studied the construction of useful low-dimensional representations (embeddings) of these networks for the prediction of missing relations or signs. Existing embedding methods for sign prediction generally enforce different notions of status or balance theories in their optimization function. These theories, however, are often inaccurate or incomplete, which negatively impacts method performance.

abstract:  The recent paramount success of the gig economy has introduced new business opportunities in different areas such as food delivery service. However, there are food delivery ride abusers who break the company rule by driving unauthorized vehicles that are not stated in the contract. These abusers are particularly problematic because they break the transportation regulations and unfairly take more orders. However, detecting these abusers are challenging because of lack of labeled datasets and these anomalous abusers do not frequently occur compared to normal riders. Furthermore, sequential patterns of abusing behaviors are not easy to model.

title:  ZSCRGAN: A GAN based Expectation Maximization Model for Zero-Shot Retrieval of Images from Textual Descriptions
authors:  Anurag Roy
abstract:  Most existing algorithms for cross-modal Information Retrieval are based on a supervised train-test setup, where a model learns to align the mode of the query (e.g., text) to the mode of the documents (e.g., images) from a given training set. Such a setup assumes that the training set contains an exhaustive representation of all possible classes of queries. In reality, a retrieval model may need to be deployed on previously unseen classes, which implies a zero-shot IR setup. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based model for zero-shot text to image retrieval. When given a textual description as the query, our model can retrieve relevant images in a zero-shot setup. The proposed model is trained using an Expectation-Maximization framework. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed model comfortably outperforms several state-of-the-art zero-shot text to image retrieval models, as well as zero-shot classification and hashing models suitably used for retrieval.

title:  Active Search using Meta-Bandits
authors:  Shengli Zhu
abstract:  There are many applications where positive instances are rare but important to identify. For example, in NLP, positive sentences for a given relation are rare in a large corpus. Positive data are more informative for learning in these applications, but before one labels a certain amount of data, it is unknown where to find the rare positives. Since random sampling can lead to significant waste in labeling effort, previous 'active search' methods use a single bandit model to learn about the data distribution (exploration) while sampling from the regions potentially containing more positives (exploitation). Many bandit models are possible and a sub-optimal model reduces labeling efficiency, but the optimal model is unknown before any data are labeled. We propose Meta-AS (Meta Active Search) that uses a meta-bandit to evaluate a set of base bandits and aims to label positive examples efficiently, comparing to the optimal base bandit with hindsight. The meta-bandit estimates the mean and variance of the performance of the base bandits and selects a base bandit to propose what data to label next for exploration or exploitation. The feedback in the labels updates both the base bandits and the meta-bandit for the next round. Meta-AS can accommodate a diverse set of base bandits to explore assumptions about the dataset, without over-committing to a single model before labeling starts. Experiments on five datasets for relation extraction demonstrate that Meta-AS labels positives more efficiently than the base bandits and other bandit selection strategies.

title:  On the Reasons Behind Decisions | Adnan Darwiche | ECAI 2020
authors:  UCLA Automated Reasoning Group
abstract:  Recent work has shown that some common machine learning classifiers can be compiled into Boolean circuits that have the same input-output behavior. We present a theory for unveiling the reasons behind the decisions made by Boolean classifiers and study some of its theoretical and practical implications. We define notions such as sufficient, necessary and complete reasons behind decisions, in addition to classifier and decision bias. We show how these notions can be used to evaluate counterfactual statements such as “a decision will stick even if . . . because . . . .” We present efficient algorithms for computing these notions, which are based on new advances on tractable Boolean circuits, and illustrate them using a case study.

title:  [ECCV 2020 Oral Long Talk] ForkGAN: Seeing into the Rainy Night
authors:  Nicole Xinran Han
abstract:  We present a ForkGAN for task-agnostic image translation that can boost multiple vision tasks in adverse weather conditions. Three tasks of image localization/retrieval, semantic image segmentation, and object detection are evaluated. The key challenge is achieving high-quality image translation without any explicit supervision, or task awareness. Our innovation is a fork-shape generator with one encoder and two decoders that disentangles the domain-specific and domain-invariant information. We force the cyclic translation between the weather conditions to go through a common encoding space, and make sure the encoding features reveal no information about the domains. Experimental results show our algorithm produces state-of-the-art image synthesis results and boost three vision tasks' performances in adverse weathers.

title:  Diffraction Line Imaging (ECCV 2020 Oral)
authors:  Mark Sheinin
abstract:  We present a novel computational imaging principle that combines diffractive optics with line (1D) sensing. When light passes through a diffraction grating, it disperses as a function of wavelength. We exploit this principle to recover 2D and even 3D positions from only line images. We derive a detailed image formation model and a learning-based algorithm for 2D position estimation. We show several extensions of our system to improve the accuracy of the 2D positioning and expand the effective field of view. We demonstrate our approach in two applications: (a) fast passive imaging of sparse light sources like street lamps, headlights at night and LED-based motion capture, and (b) structured light 3D scanning with line illumination and line sensing. Line imaging has several advantages over 2D sensors: high frame rate, high dynamic range, high fill-factor with additional on-chip computation, low cost beyond the visible spectrum, and high energy efficiency when used with line illumination. Thus, our system is able to achieve high-speed and high-accuracy 2D positioning of light sources and 3D scanning of scenes.

title:  [ECCV Spotlight] DH3D: Deep Hierarchical 3D Descriptors for Robust Large-Scale 6DoF Relocalization
authors:  cvprtum
abstract:  For relocalization in large-scale point clouds, we propose the first approach that unifies global place recognition and local 6DoF pose refinement. To this end, we design a Siamese network that jointly learns 3D local feature detection and description directly from raw 3D points. It integrates FlexConv and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) to assure that the learned local descriptor captures multi-level geometric information and channel-wise relations. For detecting 3D keypoints we predict the discriminativeness of the local descriptors in an unsupervised manner. We generate the global descriptor by directly aggregating the learned local descriptors with an effective attention mechanism. In this way, local and global 3D descriptors are inferred in one single forward pass. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results for both global point cloud retrieval and for local point cloud registration in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. To validate the generalizability and robustness of our 3D keypoints, we demonstrate that our method also performs favorably without fine-tuning on registration of point clouds that were generated by a visual SLAM system.

title:  [ECCV 2020] Privacy Preserving Structure-form-Motion
authors:  CrossMinds Editorial Team
abstract:  Over the last years, visual localization and mapping solutions have been adopted by an increasing number of mixed reality and robotics systems. The recent trend towards cloud-based localization and mapping systems has raised significant privacy concerns. These are mainly grounded by the fact that these services require users to upload visual data to their servers, which can reveal potentially confidential information, even if only derived image features are uploaded. Recent research addresses some of these concerns for the task of image-based localization by concealing the geometry of the query images and database maps. The core idea of the approach is to lift 2D/3D feature points to random lines, while still providing sufficient  constraints for camera pose estimation. In this paper, we further build upon this idea and propose solutions to the different core algorithms of an incremental Structure-from-Motion pipeline based on random line features. With this work, we make another fundamental step towards enabling privacy preserving cloud-based mapping solutions. Various experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate the practicality of our approach achieving comparable results to standard Structure-from-Motion systems.

title:  [ECCV 2020] Unsupervised Cross-Modal Alignment For Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation (10 min talk)
authors:  Video Analytics Lab
abstract:  We present a deployment friendly, fast bottom-up framework for multi-person 3D human pose estimation. We adopt a novel neural representation of multi-person 3D pose which unifies the position of person instances with their corresponding 3D pose representation. This is realized by learning a generative pose embedding which not only ensures plausible 3D pose predictions, but also eliminates the usual keypoint grouping operation as employed in prior bottom-up approaches. Further, we propose a practical deployment paradigm where paired 2D or 3D pose annotations are unavailable. In the absence of any paired supervision, we leverage a frozen network, as a teacher model, which is trained on an auxiliary task of multi-person 2D pose estimation. We cast the learning as a cross-modal alignment problem and propose training objectives to realize a shared latent space between two diverse modalities. We aim to enhance the model's ability to perform beyond the limiting teacher network by enriching the latent-to-3D pose mapping using artificially synthesized multi-person 3D scene samples. Our approach not only generalizes to in-the-wild images, but also yields a superior trade-off between speed and performance, compared to prior top-down approaches. Our approach also yields state-of-the-art multi-person 3D pose estimation performance among the bottom-up approaches under consistent supervision levels.

title:  Appearance Consensus Driven Self-Supervised Human Mesh Recovery (ECCV 2020 Oral, Long Talk)
authors:  Rakesh Mugalodi
abstract:  We present a self-supervised human mesh recovery framework to infer human pose and shape from monocular images in the absence of any paired supervision. Recent advances have shifted the interest towards directly regressing parameters of a parametric human model by super-vising them on large-scale datasets with 2D landmark annotations. This limits the generalizability of such approaches to operate on images from unlabeled wild environments. Acknowledging this we propose a novel appearance consensus-driven self-supervised objective. To effectively dis-entangle the foreground (FG) human we rely on image pairs depicting the same person (consistent FG) in varied pose and background (BG) which are obtained from unlabeled wild videos. The proposed FG appearance consistency objective makes use of a novel, differentiable colors-recovery module to obtain vertex colors without the need for any appearance net-work; via efficient realization of color-picking and reflectional symmetry. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the standard model-based 3D pose estimation benchmarks at comparable supervision levels. Furthermore, the resulting colored mesh prediction opens up the usage of our framework for a variety of appearance-related tasks beyond the pose and shape estimation, thus establishing our superior generalizability.

abstract:  Existing methods for instance segmentation in videos typically involve multi-stage pipelines that follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm and model a video clip as a sequence of images. Multiple networks are used to detect objects in individual frames, and then associate these detections over time. Multiple networks are used to detect objects in individual frames, and subsequently associate them over time. Hence, these methods are often non-end-to-end trainable and highly tailored to specific tasks.

authors:  Lee Chankyu
abstract:  Over the past years, majority of optical flow estimation techniques relied on images from traditional frame-based cameras, where the input data is obtained by sampling intensities on the entire frame at fixed time intervals irrespective of the scene dynamics. Although sufficient for certain computer vision applications, frame-based cameras suffer from issues such as motion blur during high speed motion, inability to capture information in low-light conditions, and over- or under-saturation in high dynamic range environments.

title:  [ECCV'20] Domain-Specific Mappings for Generative Adversarial Style Transfer
authors:  Hsin-Yu Chang
abstract:  Style transfer generates an image whose content comes from one image and style from the other. Image-to-image translation approaches with disentangled representations have been shown effective for style transfer between two image categories. However, previous methods often assume a shared domain-invariant content space, which could compromise the content representation power. For addressing this issue, this paper leverages domain-specific mappings for remapping latent features in the shared content space to domain-specific content spaces. This way, images can be encoded more properly for style transfer. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms previous style transfer methods, particularly on challenging scenarios that would require semantic correspondences between images.

title:  Deformable Style Transfer (ECCV 2020) - 10min Talk
authors:  Sunnie S. Y. Kim
abstract:  Both geometry and texture are fundamental aspects of visual style. Existing style transfer methods, however, primarily focus on texture, almost entirely ignoring geometry. We propose deformable style transfer (DST), an optimization-based approach that jointly stylizes the texture and geometry of a content image to better match a style image. Unlike previous geometry-aware stylization methods, our approach is neither restricted to a particular domain (such as human faces), nor does it require training sets of matching style/content pairs. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of content and style images including portraits, animals, objects, scenes, and paintings.

title:  Contact and Human Dynamics from Monocular Video (ECCV 2020)
authors:  Davis Winston Rempe
abstract:  Existing deep models predict 2D and 3D kinematic poses from video that are approximately accurate, but contain visible errors that violate physical constraints, such as feet penetrating the ground and bodies leaning at extreme angles. In this paper, we present a physics-based method for inferring 3D human motion from video sequences that takes initial 2D and 3D pose estimates as input. We first estimate ground contact timings with a novel prediction network which is trained without hand-labeled data. A physics-based trajectory optimization then solves for a physically-plausible motion, based on the inputs. We show this process produces motions that are significantly more realistic than those from purely kinematic methods, substantially improving quantitative measures of both kinematic and dynamic plausibility. We demonstrate our method on character animation and pose estimation tasks on dynamic motions of dancing and sports with complex contact patterns.

title:  Lifespan Age Transformation Synthesis
authors:  UW Reality Lab
abstract:  We address the problem of single photo age progression and regression---the prediction of how a person might look in the future, or how they looked in the past. Most existing aging methods are limited to changing the texture, overlooking transformations in head shape that occur during the human aging and growth process. This limits the applicability of previous methods to aging of adults to slightly older adults, and application of those methods to photos of children does not produce quality results. We propose a novel multi-domain image-to-image generative adversarial network architecture, whose learned latent space models a continuous bi-directional aging process. The network is trained on the FFHQ dataset, which we labeled for ages, gender, and semantic segmentation. Fixed age classes are used as anchors to approximate continuous age transformation. Our framework can predict a full head portrait for ages 0--70 from a single photo, modifying both texture and shape of the head. We demonstrate results on a wide variety of photos and datasets, and show significant improvement over the state of the art.

title:  DeepFit : 3D Surface Fitting via Neural Network Weighted Least Squares (ECCV 2020 Oral)
authors:  Yizhak Ben-Shabat
abstract:  We propose a surface fitting method for unstructured 3D point clouds. This method, called DeepFit, incorporates a neural network to learn point-wise weights for weighted least squares polynomial surface fitting. The learned weights act as a soft selection for the neighbourhood of surface points thus avoiding the scale selection required of previous methods. To train the network we propose a novel surface consistency loss that improves point weight estimation. The method enables extracting normal vectors and other geometrical properties, such as principal curvatures, the latter were not presented as ground truth during training. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a benchmark normal and curvature estimation dataset, demonstrate robustness to noise, outliers and density variations, and show its application on noise removal.

title:  (ECCV 2020) DLow: Diversifying Latent Flows for Diverse Human Motion Prediction (Talk)
authors:  Ye Yuan
abstract:  Deep generative models are often used for human motion prediction as they are able to model multi-modal data distributions and characterize diverse human behavior. While much care has been taken into designing and learning deep generative models, how to efficiently produce diverse samples from a deep generative model after it has been trained is still an under-explored problem. To obtain samples from a pretrained generative model, most existing generative human motion prediction methods draw a set of independent Gaussian latent codes and convert them to motion samples. Clearly, this random sampling strategy is not guaranteed to produce diverse samples for two reasons: (1) The independent sampling cannot force the samples to be diverse; (2) The sampling is based solely on likelihood which may only produce samples that correspond to the major modes of the data distribution. To address these problems, we propose a novel sampling method, Diversifying Latent Flows (DLow), to produce a diverse set of samples from a pretrained deep generative model. Unlike random (independent) sampling, the proposed DLow sampling method samples a single random variable and then maps it with a set of learnable mapping functions to a set of correlated latent codes. The correlated latent codes are then decoded into a set of correlated samples. During training, DLow uses a diversity-promoting prior over samples as an objective to optimize the latent mappings to improve sample diversity. The design of the prior is highly flexible and can be customized to generate diverse motions with common features (e.g., similar leg motion but diverse upper-body motion). Our experiments demonstrate that DLow outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of sample diversity and accuracy.

title:  [ECCV 2020 Best Paper] RAFT: A New Deep Network Architecture For Optical Flow
authors:  What's AI
abstract:  We introduce Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT), a new deep network architecture for estimating optical flow. RAFT extracts per-pixel features, builds multi-scale 4D correlation volumes for all pairs of pixels, and iteratively updates a flow field through a recurrent unit that performs lookups on the correlation volumes. RAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both KITTI and Sintel, with strong cross-dataset generalization and high efficiency in inference time, training speed, and parameter count.

title:  [ECCV 2020] BroadFace : Face Recognition
authors:  Kakao Enterprise
abstract:  The datasets of face recognition contain an enormous number of identities and instances. However, conventional methods have difficulty in reflecting the entire distribution of the datasets because a mini-batch of small size contains only a small portion of all identities. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel method called BroadFace, which is a learning process to consider a massive set of identities, comprehensively. In BroadFace, a linear classifier learns optimal decision boundaries among identities from a large number of embedding vectors accumulated over past iterations. By referring more instances at once, the optimality of the classifier is naturally increased on the entire datasets. Thus, the encoder is also globally optimized by referring the weight matrix of the classifier. Moreover, we propose a novel compensation method to increase the number of referenced instances in the training stage. BroadFace can be easily applied on many existing methods to accelerate a learning process and obtain a significant improvement in accuracy without extra computational burden at inference stage. We perform extensive ablation studies and experiments on various datasets to show the effectiveness of BroadFace, and also empirically prove the validity of our compensation method. BroadFace achieves the state-of-the-art results with significant improvements on nine datasets in 1:1 face verification and 1:N face identification tasks, and is also effective in image retrieval.

title:  [ECCV 2020] Class-Incremental Domain Adaptation (10 min talk)
authors:  Video Analytics Lab
abstract:  We introduce a practical Domain Adaptation (DA) paradigm called Class-Incremental Domain Adaptation (CIDA). Existing DA methods tackle domain-shift but are unsuitable for learning novel target-domain classes. Meanwhile, class-incremental (CI) methods enable learning of new classes in absence of source training data, but fail under a domain-shift without labeled supervision. In this work, we effectively identify the limitations of these approaches in the CIDA paradigm. Motivated by theoretical and empirical observations, we propose an effective method, inspired by prototypical networks, that enables classification of target samples into both shared and novel (one-shot) target classes, even under a domain-shift. Our approach yields superior performance as compared to both DA and CI methods in the CIDA paradigm.

title:  [ECCV2020 Oral] TextCaps: a Dataset for Image Captioning with Reading Comprehension
authors:  Oleksii Sidorov
abstract:  Image descriptions can help visually impaired people to quickly understand the image content. While we made significant progress in automatically describing images and optical character recognition, current approaches are unable to include written text in their descriptions, although text is omnipresent in human environments and frequently critical to understand our surroundings. To study how to comprehend text in the context of an image we collect a novel dataset, TextCaps, with 145k captions for 28k images. Our dataset challenges a model to recognize text, relate it to its visual context, and decide what part of the text to copy or paraphrase, requiring spatial, semantic, and visual reasoning between multiple text tokens and visual entities, such as objects. We study baselines and adapt existing approaches to this new task, which we refer to as image captioning with reading comprehension. Our analysis with automatic and human studies shows that our new TextCaps dataset provides many new technical challenges over previous datasets.

title:  [CVPR'20 Oral] Self-Supervised 3D Human Pose Estimation via Part Guided Novel Image Synthesis (long)
authors:  Video Analytics Lab
abstract:  Camera captured human pose is an outcome of several sources of variation. Performance of supervised 3D pose estimation approaches comes at the cost of dispensing with variations, such as shape and appearance, that may be useful for solving other related tasks. As a result, the learned model not only inculcates task-bias but also dataset-bias because of its strong reliance on the annotated samples, which also holds true for weakly-supervised models. Acknowledging this, we propose a self-supervised learning framework to disentangle such variations from unlabeled video frames. We leverage the prior knowledge on human skeleton and poses in the form of a single part based 2D puppet model, human pose articulation constraints, and a set of unpaired 3D poses. Our differentiable formalization, bridging the representation gap between the 3D pose and spatial part maps, not only facilitates discovery of interpretable pose disentanglement, but also allows us to operate on videos with diverse camera movements. Qualitative results on unseen in-the-wild datasets establish our superior generalization across multiple tasks beyond the primary tasks of 3D pose estimation and part segmentation. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-the-art weakly supervised 3D pose estimation performance on both Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

title:  Sound2Sight: Generating Video Dynamics from Sound and Context
authors:  Anoop Cherian
abstract:  Learning associations across modalities is critical for robust multimodal reasoning, especially when a modality may be missing during inference. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of audio-conditioned visual synthesis -- a task that is important, for example, in occlusion reasoning. Specifically, our goal is to generate future video frames and their motion dynamics conditioned on audio and a few past frames. To tackle this problem, we present Sound2Sight, a deep variational framework, that is trained to learn a per frame stochastic prior conditioned on a joint embedding of audio and past frames. This embedding is learned via a multi-head attention-based audio-visual transformer encoder. The learned prior is then sampled to further condition a video forecasting module to generate future frames. The stochastic prior allows the model to sample multiple plausible futures that are consistent with the provided audio and the past context. Moreover, to improve the quality and coherence of the generated frames, we propose a multimodal discriminator that differentiates between a synthesized and a real audio-visual clip. We empirically evaluate our approach, vis-á-vis closely-related prior methods, on two new datasets viz. (i) Multimodal Stochastic Moving MNIST with a Surprise Obstacle, (ii) Youtube Paintings; as well as on the existing Audio-Set Drums dataset. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Sound2Sight significantly outperforms the state of the art in the generated video quality, while also producing diverse video content.

title:  Self-supervised Video Representation Learning by Pace Prediction.
authors:  Jiangliu Wang
abstract:  This paper addresses the problem of self-supervised video representation learning from a new perspective -- by video pace prediction. It stems from the observation that human visual system is sensitive to video pace, e.g., slow motion, a widely used technique in film making. Specifically, given a video played in natural pace, we randomly sample training clips in different paces and ask a neural network to identify the pace for each video clip. The assumption here is that the network can only succeed in such a pace reasoning task when it understands the underlying video content and learns representative spatio-temporal features. In addition, we further introduce contrastive learning to push the model towards discriminating different paces by maximizing the agreement on similar video content. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on action recognition and video retrieval tasks with several alternative network architectures. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for self-supervised video representation learning across different network architectures and different benchmarks.  The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/laura-wang/video-pace.

title:  Learning Predictive Models From Observation and Interaction
authors:  Karl Schmeckpeper
abstract:  Learning predictive models from interaction with the world allows an agent, such as a robot, to learn about how the world works, and then use this learned model to plan coordinated sequences of actions to bring about desired outcomes. However, learning a model that captures the dynamics of complex skills represents a major challenge: if the agent needs a good model to perform these skills, it might never be able to collect the experience on its own that is required to learn these delicate and complex behaviors. Instead, we can imagine augmenting the training set with observational data of other agents, such as humans. Such data is likely more plentiful, but cannot always be combined with data from the original agent. For example, videos of humans might show a robot how to use a tool, but (i) are not annotated with suitable robot actions, and (ii) contain a systematic distributional shift due to the embodiment differences between humans and robots. We address the first challenge by formulating the corresponding graphical model and treating the action as an observed variable for the interaction data and an unobserved variable for the observation data, and the second challenge by using a domain-dependent prior. In addition to interaction data, our method is able to leverage videos of passive observations in a driving dataset and a dataset of robotic manipulation videos to improve video prediction performance. We also demonstrate that, in a real-world tabletop robotic manipulation setting, we are able to significantly improve control performance by learning a model from both robot data and observations of humans.

title:  Diffraction Line Imaging (ECCV Oral 10min talk)
authors:  Mark Sheinin
abstract:  We present a novel computational imaging principle that combines diffractive optics with line (1D) sensing. When light passes through a diffraction grating, it disperses as a function of wavelength. We exploit this principle to recover 2D and even 3D positions from only line images. We derive a detailed image formation model and a learning-based algorithm for 2D position estimation. We show several extensions of our system to improve the accuracy of the 2D positioning and expand the effective field of view. We demonstrate our approach in two applications: (a) fast passive imaging of sparse light sources like street lamps, headlights at night and LED-based motion capture, and (b) structured light 3D scanning with line illumination and line sensing. Line imaging has several advantages over 2D sensors: high frame rate, high dynamic range, high fill-factor with additional on-chip computation, low cost beyond the visible spectrum, and high energy efficiency when used with line illumination. Thus, our system is able to achieve high-speed and high-accuracy 2D positioning of light sources and 3D scanning of scenes.

title:  Memento: Multimodal Memorability (ECCV 2020 video presentation)
authors:  Anelise Newman
abstract:  A key capability of an intelligent system is deciding when events from past experience must be remembered and when they can be forgotten. Towards this goal, we develop a predictive model of human visual event memory and how those memories decay over time. We introduce Memento10k, a new, dynamic video memorability dataset containing human annotations at different viewing delays. Based on our findings we propose a new mathematical formulation of memorability decay, resulting in a model that is able to produce the first quantitative estimation of how a video decays in memory over time. In contrast with previous work, our model can predict the probability that a video will be remembered at an arbitrary delay. Importantly, our approach is multimodal, combining visual and semantic information to fully represent the meaning of events. Our experiments on two video memorability benchmarks, including Memento10k, show that our model significantly improves upon the best prior approach (by 12% on average).

title:  ECCV 2020 Presentation "DVI: Depth Guided Video Inpainting for Autonomous Driving "
authors:  Sibo Zhang
abstract:  To get clear street-view and photo-realistic simulation in autonomous driving, we present an automatic video inpainting algorithm that can remove traffic agents from videos and synthesize missing regions with the guidance of depth/point cloud.  By building a  dense  3D  map from stitched point clouds, frames within a video are geometrically correlated via this common 3D map. To fill target inpainting area in a frame, it is straightforward to transform pixels from other frames into the current one with correct occlusion. Furthermore, we are able to fuse multiple videos through 3D point cloud registration, making it possible to inpaint a target video with multiple source videos. The motivation is to solve the long-time occlusion problem where an occluded area has never been visible in the entire video. To our knowledge, we are the first to fuse multiple videos for video inpainting. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we build a large inpainting dataset in the real urban road environment with synchronized images and Lidar data including many challenge scenes, e.g., long time occlusion. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperform the state-of-the-art approaches for all the criteria, especially the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) has been reduced by about13%

title:  Energy-Based Models for Deep Probabilistic Regression | ECCV 2020 | 1 min Video
authors:  Fredrik Gustafsson
abstract:  While deep learning-based classification is generally tackled using standardized approaches, a wide variety of techniques are employed for regression. In computer vision, one particularly popular such technique is that of confidence-based regression, which entails predicting a confidence value for each input-target pair (x,y). While this approach has demonstrated impressive results, it requires important task-dependent design choices, and the predicted confidences lack a natural probabilistic meaning. We address these issues by proposing a general and conceptually simple regression method with a clear probabilistic interpretation. In our proposed approach, we create an energy-based model of the conditional target density p(y|x), using a deep neural network to predict the un-normalized density from (x,y). This model of p(y|x) is trained by directly minimizing the associated negative log-likelihood, approximated using Monte Carlo sampling. We perform comprehensive experiments on four computer vision regression tasks. Our approach outperforms direct regression, as well as other probabilistic and confidence-based methods. Notably, our model achieves a 2.2% AP improvement over Faster-RCNN for object detection on the COCO dataset, and sets a new state-of-the-art on visual tracking when applied for bounding box estimation. In contrast to confidence-based methods, our approach is also shown to be directly applicable to more general tasks such as age and head-pose estimation.

title:  Unified Image and Video Saliency Modeling - UNISAL (ECCV 2020)
authors:  Richard Droste
abstract:  Visual saliency modeling for images and videos is treated as two independent tasks in recent computer vision literature. While image saliency modeling is a well-studied problem and progress on benchmarks like SALICON and MIT300 is slowing, video saliency models have shown rapid gains on the recent DHF1K benchmark. Here, we take a step back and ask: Can image and video saliency modeling be approached via a unified model, with mutual benefit? We identify different sources of domain shift between image and video saliency data and between different video saliency datasets as a key challenge for effective joint modelling. To address this we propose four novel domain adaptation techniques - Domain-Adaptive Priors, Domain-Adaptive Fusion, Domain-Adaptive Smoothing and Bypass-RNN - in addition to an improved formulation of learned Gaussian priors. We integrate these techniques into a simple and lightweight encoder-RNN-decoder-style network, UNISAL, and train it jointly with image and video saliency data. We evaluate our method on the video saliency datasets DHF1K, Hollywood-2 and UCF-Sports, and the image saliency datasets SALICON and MIT300. With one set of parameters, UNISAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on all video saliency datasets and is on par with the state-of-the-art for image saliency datasets, despite faster runtime and a 5 to 20-fold smaller model size compared to all competing deep methods. We provide retrospective analyses and ablation studies which confirm the importance of the domain shift modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/rdroste/unisal.

title:  EasyRFP: An Easy to Use Edge Computing Toolkit for Real-Time Field Phenotyping
authors:  Akshay L Chandra
abstract:  Recent advances in deep learning have catalyzed rapid progress in high throughput field phenotyping. Much research has been dedicated towards developing accurate and cost effective deep learning models to capture phenotyping traits such as plant stress, yield and plant growth stages.  However, there is a shortage of software tools to promote the usage of such intelligent methods among plant phenotyping practitioners and researchers. To bridge this gap, we developed EasyRFP, a Flask back-end, Angular front-end software toolkit which can be interfaced with any commercial GPU enabled micro computer (such as NVIDIA Jetson) and a digital camera.

title:  PointTriNet: Learned Triangulation of 3D Point Sets (ECCV 2020)
authors:  nmwsharp
abstract:  This work considers a new task in geometric deep learning: generating a triangulation among a set of points in 3D space. We present PointTriNet, a differentiable and scalable approach enabling point set triangulation as a layer in 3D learning pipelines. The method iteratively applies two neural networks: a classification network predicts whether a candidate triangle should appear in the triangulation, while a proposal network suggests additional candidates. Both networks are structured as PointNets over nearby points and triangles, using a novel triangle-relative input encoding. Since these learning problems operate on local geometric data, our method is efficient and scalable, and generalizes to unseen shape categories. Our networks are trained in an unsupervised manner from a collection of shapes represented as point clouds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for classical meshing tasks, robustness to outliers, and as a component in end-to-end learning systems.

title:  [ECCV 2020] Attention Guided Anomaly Localization in Images
authors:  Shashank Venkataramanan
abstract:  Anomaly localization is an important problem in computer vision which involves localizing anomalous regions within images with applications in industrial inspection, surveillance, and medical imaging. This task is challenging due to the small sample size and pixel coverage of the anomaly in real-world scenarios. Most prior works need to use anomalous training images to compute a class-specific threshold to localize anomalies. Without the need of anomalous training images, we propose Convolutional Adversarial Variational autoencoder with Guided Attention (CAVGA), which localizes the anomaly with a convolutional latent variable to preserve the spatial information. In the unsupervised setting, we propose an attention expansion loss where we encourage CAVGA to focus on all normal regions in the image. Furthermore, in the weakly-supervised setting we propose a complementary guided attention loss, where we encourage the attention map to focus on all normal regions while minimizing the attention map corresponding to anomalous regions in the image. CAVGA outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly localization methods on MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTAD), modified ShanghaiTech Campus (mSTC) and Large-scale Attention based Glaucoma (LAG) datasets in the unsupervised setting and when using only 2% anomalous images in the weakly-supervised setting. CAVGA also outperforms SOTA anomaly detection methods on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MVTAD, mSTC and LAG datasets.

title:  DeepFit : 3D Surface Fitting via Neural Network Weighted Least Squares (ECCV 2020 Oral) - 2 minutes
authors:  Yizhak Ben-Shabat
abstract:  We propose a surface fitting method for unstructured 3D point clouds. This method, called DeepFit, incorporates a neural network to learn point-wise weights for weighted least squares polynomial surface fitting. The learned weights act as a soft selection for the neighbourhood of surface points thus avoiding the scale selection required of previous methods. To train the network we propose a novel surface consistency loss that improves point weight estimation. The method enables extracting normal vectors and other geometrical properties, such as principal curvatures, the latter were not presented as ground truth during training. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a benchmark normal and curvature estimation dataset, demonstrate robustness to noise, outliers and density variations, and show its application on noise removal.

title:  Structured3D: A Large Photo-realistic Dataset for Structured 3D Modeling
authors:  Jia Zheng
abstract:  Recently, there has been growing interest in developing learning-based methods to detect and utilize salient semi-global or global structures, such as junctions, lines, planes, cuboids, smooth surfaces, and all types of symmetries, for 3D scene modeling and understanding. However, the ground truth annotations are often obtained via human labor, which is particularly challenging and inefficient for such tasks due to the large number of 3D structure instances (e.g., line segments) and other factors such as viewpoints and occlusions. In this paper, we present a new synthetic dataset, Structured3D, with the aim of providing large-scale photo-realistic images with rich 3D structure annotations for a wide spectrum of structured 3D modeling tasks. We take advantage of the availability of professional interior designs and automatically extract 3D structures from them. We generate high-quality images with an industry-leading rendering engine. We use our synthetic dataset in combination with real images to train deep networks for room layout estimation and demonstrate improved performance on benchmark datasets.

title:  MGP-VAE
authors:  Shagun Uppal
abstract:  We introduce MGP-VAE (Multi-disentangled-features Gaussian Processes Variational AutoEncoder), a variational autoencoder which uses Gaussian processes (GP) to model the latent space for the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations in video sequences. We improve upon previous work by establishing a framework by which multiple features, static or dynamic, can be disentangled. Specifically we use fractional Brownian motions (fBM) and Brownian bridges (BB) to enforce an inter-frame correlation structure in each independent channel, and show that varying this structure enables one to capture different factors of variation in the data. We demonstrate the quality of our representations with experiments on three publicly available datasets, and also quantify the improvement using a video prediction task. Moreover, we introduce a novel geodesic loss function which takes into account the curvature of the data manifold to improve learning. Our experiments show that the combination of the improved representations with the novel loss function enable MGP-VAE to outperform the baselines in video prediction.

title:  Shonan Rotation Averaging
authors:  Frank Dellaert
abstract:  Shonan Rotation Averaging is a fast, simple, and elegant rotation averaging algorithm that is guaranteed to recover globally optimal solutions under mild assumptions on the measurement noise. Our method employs semidefinite relaxation in order to recover provably globally optimal solutions of the rotation averaging problem. In contrast to prior work, we show how to solve large-scale instances of these relaxations us- ing manifold minimization on (only slightly) higher-dimensional rotation manifolds, re-using existing high-performance (but local) structure-from- motion pipelines. Our method thus preserves the speed and scalability of current SFM methods, while recovering globally optimal solutions.

title:  GOTO 2019 • Prioritizing Technical Debt as if Time and Money Matters • Adam Tornhill
authors:  GOTO Conferences
abstract:  Many codebases contain code that is overly complicated, hard to understand, and hence expensive to change and evolve. Prioritizing technical debt is a hard problem as modern systems might have millions of lines of code and multiple development teams -- no-one has a holistic overview. In addition, there's always a trade-off between improving existing code versus adding new features so we need to use our time wisely. So what if we could mine the collective intelligence of all contributing programmers, and start to make decisions based on information from how the organization actually works with the code?

abstract:  When you examine the write path of nearly any kind of database, the first thing you find is a commit log: mutations enter the database, and they are stored as immutable events in a queue, only some hundreds of microseconds later to be organized into the various views that the data model demands. Those views can be quite handy–graphs, documents, triples, tables—but they are always derived interpretations of a stream of changes.

authors:  GOTO Conferences
abstract:  When engineering teams take on a new project, they often optimize for performance, availability, or fault tolerance. More experienced teams can optimize for these properties simultaneously. Now add an additional property: feature velocity. Organizations often try to optimize for feature velocity through process improvements and engineering hierarchy, but some optimize for feature velocity through explicit architectural decisions. These decisions increase the complexity of the system. This sounds like a trade-off: you get feature velocity, but for the price of increased complexity.

authors:  GOTO Conferences
abstract:  Speed matters, and developers are challenged to reduce latency in their applications at every turn. In traditional synchronous programming patterns, users are asked to monitor the spinning wheel as the application moves from one task to the next until a response can be returned. However, developers can reclaim these precious milliseconds by learning to think asynchronously.

title:  GOTO 2019 • How Java & Scala are Imitating Functional Languages • Maurice Naftalin & José Paumard
authors:  GOTO Conferences
abstract:  Functional programmers have been saying for decades that they know the way to the future. Clearly they've been wrong, since imperative languages are still far more popular. Clearly they've also been right, as the advantages of functional programming have become increasingly obvious.

title:  GOTO 2020 • Advanced Feature Flagging: It's All About The Data • Dave Karow
authors:  GOTO Conferences
abstract:  Feature flags deliver the control needed to decouple deploy from release but can break traditional monitoring and KPIs. The good news is that teams are using them to "kill the release night" by moving from big-bang releases to gradual releases during normal business hours. The bad news is that gradual release techniques add challenges to traditional ways of monitoring system health and user behavior. No one wants to move faster if that means less visibility and thus greater risk.

title:  GOTO 2020 • Practical End-to-End Container Security at Scale • Yashvier Kosaraju
authors:  GOTO Conferences
abstract:  Deploying containers using Kubernetes has become the new defacto deployment standard most companies are turning towards. Developing with containers is very different from traditional development practices and so is securing these containers & deployments. Traditional approaches of security do not scale well with the high paced container world. Automation and CI-CD integrations are more effective ways of keeping your containers secure without slowing your development practices.

title:  [ICCV 2019] Ego-Pose Estimation and Forecasting as Real-Time PD Control
authors:  Ye Yuan
abstract:  We propose the use of a proportional-derivative (PD) control based policy learned via reinforcement learning (RL) to estimate and forecast 3D human pose from egocentric videos. The method learns directly from unsegmented egocentric videos and motion capture data consisting of various complex human motions (e.g., crouching, hopping, bending, and motion transitions). We propose a video-conditioned recurrent control technique to forecast physically-valid and stable future motions of arbitrary length. We also introduce a value function based fail-safe mechanism which enables our method to run as a single pass algorithm over the video data. Experiments with both controlled and in-the-wild data show that our approach outperforms previous art in both quantitative metrics and visual quality of the motions, and is also robust enough to transfer directly to real-world scenarios. Additionally, our time analysis shows that the combined use of our pose estimation and forecasting can run at 30 FPS, making it suitable for real-time applications.

title:  Probing Emergent Semantics in Predictive Agents via Question Answering
authors:  Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech
abstract:  Recent work has shown how predictive modeling can endow agents with rich knowledge of their surroundings, improving their ability to act in complex environments. We propose question-answering as a general paradigm to decode and understand the representations that such agents develop, applying our method to two recent approaches to predictive modeling -action-conditional CPC (Guo et al., 2018) and SimCore (Gregor et al., 2019). After training agents with these predictive objectives in a visually-rich, 3D environment with an assortment of objects, colors, shapes, and spatial configurations, we probe their internal state representations with synthetic (English) questions, without backpropagating gradients from the question-answering decoder into the agent. The performance of different agents when probed this way reveals that they learn to encode factual, and seemingly compositional, information about objects, properties and spatial relations from their physical environment. Our approach is intuitive, i.e. humans can easily interpret responses of the model as opposed to inspecting continuous vectors, and model-agnostic, i.e. applicable to any modeling approach. By revealing the implicit knowledge of objects, quantities, properties and relations acquired by agents as they learn, question-conditional agent probing can stimulate the design and development of stronger predictive learning objectives.

title:  Scalable Identification of Partially Observed Systems with Certainty-Equivalent EM
authors:  kmenda
abstract:  System identification is a key step for model- based control, estimator design, and output prediction. This work considers the offline identification of partially observed nonlinear systems. We empirically show that the certainty-equivalent approximation to expectation-maximization can be a reliable and scalable approach for high-dimensional deterministic systems, which are common in robotics. We formulate certainty-equivalent expectation-maximization as block coordinate-ascent, and provide an efficient implementation. The algorithm is tested on a simulated system of coupled Lorenz attractors, demonstrating its ability to identify high-dimensional systems that can be intractable for particle-based approaches. Our approach is also used to identify the dynamics of an aerobatic helicopter. By augmenting the state with unobserved fluid states, a model is learned that predicts the acceleration of the helicopter better than state-of-the-art approaches.

title:  ICML 2020: Understanding and Mitigating the Tradeoff between Robustness and Accuracy
authors:  xie
abstract:  Adversarial training augments the training set with perturbations to improve the robust error (over worst-case perturbations), but it often leads to an increase in the standard error (on unperturbed test inputs). Previous explanations for this tradeoff rely on the assumption that no predictor in the hypothesis class has low standard and robust error. In this work, we precisely characterize the effect of augmentation on the standard error in linear regression when the optimal linear predictor has zero standard and robust error. In particular, we show that the standard error could increase even when the augmented perturbations have noiseless observations from the optimal linear predictor. We then prove that the recently proposed robust self-training (RST) estimator improves robust error without sacrificing standard error for noiseless linear regression. Empirically, for neural networks, we find that RST with different adversarial training methods improves both standard and robust error for random and adversarial rotations and adversarial l_infty perturbations in CIFAR-10.

title:  [ICML 2020 Best Paper Award Honorable Mention] Efficiently Sampling Functions from Gaussian Process Posteriors
authors:  CrossMinds Editorial Team
abstract:  Gaussian processes are the gold standard for many real-world modeling problems, especially in cases where a model’s success hinges upon its ability to faithfully represent predictive uncertainty. These problems typically exist as parts of larger frameworks, wherein quantities of interest are ultimately defined by integrating over posterior distributions. These quantities are frequently intractable, motivating the use of Monte Carlo methods. Despite substantial progress in scaling up Gaussian processes to large training sets, methods for accurately generating draws from their posterior distributions still scale cubically in the number of test locations. We identify a decomposition of Gaussian processes that naturally lends itself to scalable sampling by separating out the prior from the data. Building off of this factorization, we propose an easy-to-use and general-purpose approach for fast posterior sampling, which seamlessly pairs with sparse approximations to afford scalability both during training and at test time. In a series of experiments designed to test competing sampling schemes’ statistical properties and practical ramifications, we demonstrate how decoupled sample paths accurately represent Gaussian process posteriors at a fraction of the usual cost.

title:  A Policy Gradient Method for Task-Agnostic Exploration
authors:  Mirco Mutti
abstract:  In a reward-free environment, what is a suitable intrinsic objective for an agent to pursue so that it can learn an optimal task-agnostic exploration policy? In this paper, we argue that the entropy of the state distribution induced by limited-horizon trajectories is a sensible target. Especially, we present a novel and practical policy-search algorithm, Maximum Entropy POLicy optimization (MEPOL), to learn a policy that maximizes a non-parametric, k-nearest neighbors estimate of the state distribution entropy. In contrast to known methods, MEPOL is completely model-free as it requires neither to estimate the state distribution of any policy nor to model transition dynamics. Then, we empirically show that MEPOL allows learning a maximum-entropy exploration policy in high-dimensional, continuous-control domains, and how this policy facilitates learning a variety of meaningful reward-based tasks downstream.

title:  Logical Composition in Lifelong Reinforcement Learning
authors:  geraudnt
abstract:  The ability to produce novel behaviors from existing skills is an important property of lifelong learning agents. We build on recent work which formalises a Boolean algebra over the space of tasks and value functions, and show how this can be leveraged to tackle the lifelong learning problem. We propose an algorithm that determines whether a new task can be immediately solved using an agent’s existing abilities, or whether the task should be learned from scratch. We verify our approach in the Four Rooms domain, where an agent learns a set of skills throughout its lifetime, and then composes them to solve a combinatorially large number of new tasks in a zero-shot manner.

title:  Learning Similarity Metrics for Numerical Simulations - ICML 2020
authors:  Georg Kohl
abstract:  We propose a neural network-based approach that computes a stable and generalizing metric (LSiM) to compare data from a variety of numerical simulation sources. We focus on scalar time-dependent 2D data that commonly arises from motion and transport-based partial differential equations (PDEs). Our method employs a Siamese network architecture that is motivated by the mathematical properties of a metric. We leverage a controllable data generation setup with PDE solvers to create increasingly different outputs from a reference simulation in a controlled environment. A central component of our learned metric is a specialized loss function that introduces knowledge about the correlation between single data samples into the training process. To demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing metrics for vector spaces and other learned, image-based metrics, we evaluate the different methods on a large range of test data. Additionally, we analyze generalization benefits of an adjustable training data difficulty and demonstrate the robustness of LSiM via an evaluation on three real-world data sets.

title:  ICML 2020: Learning De-biased Representations with Biased Representations
authors:  Hyojin Bahng
abstract:  Many machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated by splitting data from a single source into training and test sets. While such focus on in-distribution learning scenarios has led to interesting advancement, it has not been able to tell if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for successful prediction (e.g., using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles), resulting in biased models that fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a different class. The cross-bias generalisation problem has been addressed by de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of a snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a de-biased representation by encouraging it to be different from a set of representations that are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many scenarios where it is much easier to define a set of biased representations than to define and quantify bias. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across a variety of synthetic and real-world biases; our experiments show that the method discourages models from taking bias shortcuts, resulting in improved generalisation.

title:  ICML 2020 Oral Talk: Planning to Explore via Self-Supervised World Models
authors:  Deepak Pathak
abstract:  Reinforcement learning allows solving complex tasks, however, the learning tends to be task-specific and the sample efficiency remains a challenge. We present Plan2Explore, a self-supervised reinforcement learning agent that tackles both these challenges through a new approach to self-supervised exploration and fast adaptation to new tasks, which need not be known during exploration. During exploration, unlike prior methods which retrospectively compute the novelty of observations after the agent has already reached them, our agent acts efficiently by leveraging planning to seek out expected future novelty. After exploration, the agent quickly adapts to multiple downstream tasks in a zero or a few-shot manner. We evaluate on challenging control tasks from high-dimensional image inputs. Without any training supervision or task-specific interaction, Plan2Explore outperforms prior self-supervised exploration methods, and in fact, almost matches the performances oracle which has access to rewards.

title:  Time-aware Large Kernel Convolutions (ICML 2020)
authors:  Vasileios Lioutas
abstract:  To date, most state-of-the-art sequence modelling architectures use attention to build generative models for language based tasks. Some of these models use all the available sequence tokens to generate an attention distribution which results in time complexity of O(n^2). Alternatively, they utilize depthwise convolutions with softmax normalized kernels of size k acting as a limited-window self-attention, resulting in time complexity of O(k⋅n). In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Large Kernel (TaLK) Convolutions, a novel adaptive convolution operation that learns to predict the size of a summation kernel instead of using the fixed-sized kernel matrix. This method yields a time complexity of O(n), effectively making the sequence encoding process linear to the number of tokens. We evaluate the proposed method on large-scale standard machine translation, ive summarization and language modelling datasets and show that TaLK Convolutions constitute an efficient improvement over other attention/convolution based approaches.

title:  [ICML 2020] Consistent Estimators for Learning to Defer to an Expert
authors:  MIT Clinical Machine Learning
abstract:  Learning algorithms are often used in conjunction with expert decision makers in practical scenarios, however this fact is largely ignored when designing these algorithms. In this paper we explore how to learn predictors that can either predict or choose to defer the decision to a downstream expert. Given only samples of the expert's decisions, we give a procedure based on learning a classifier and a rejector and analyze it theoretically. Our approach is based on a novel reduction to cost sensitive learning where we give a consistent surrogate loss for cost sensitive learning that generalizes the cross entropy loss. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of experimental tasks.

title:  (ICML2020) Online Dense Subgraph Discovery via Blurred-Graph Feedback
authors:  yuumin-channel
abstract:  Dense subgraph discovery aims to find a dense component in edge-weighted graphs. This is a fundamental graph-mining task with a variety of applications and thus has received much attention recently. Although most existing methods assume that each individual edge weight is easily obtained, such an assumption is not necessarily valid in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning problem for dense subgraph discovery in which a learner queries edge subsets rather than only single edges and observes a noisy sum of edge weights in a queried subset. For this problem, we first propose a polynomial-time algorithm that obtains a nearly-optimal solution with high probability. Moreover, to deal with large-sized graphs, we design a more scalable algorithm with a theoretical guarantee. Computational experiments using real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.

title:  One Policy to Control Them All
authors:  Deepak Pathak
abstract:  Reinforcement learning is typically concerned with learning control policies tailored to a particular agent. We investigate whether there exists a single global policy that can generalize to control a wide variety of agent morphologies -- ones in which even dimensionality of state and action spaces changes. We propose to express this global policy as a collection of identical modular neural networks, dubbed as Shared Modular Policies (SMP), that correspond to each of the agent's actuators. Every module is only responsible for controlling its corresponding actuator and receives information from only its local sensors. In addition, messages are passed between modules, propagating information between distant modules. We show that a single modular policy can successfully generate locomotion behaviors for several planar agents with different skeletal structures such as monopod hoppers, quadrupeds, bipeds, and generalize to variants not seen during training -- a process that would normally require training and manual hyperparameter tuning for each morphology. We observe that a wide variety of drastically diverse locomotion styles across morphologies as well as centralized coordination emerges via message passing between decentralized modules purely from the reinforcement learning objective.

title:  Transformer Hawkes Process
authors:  Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech
abstract:  Modern data acquisition routinely produce massive amounts of event sequence data in various domains, such as social media, healthcare, and financial markets. These data often exhibit complicated short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing recurrent neural network-based point process models fail to capture such dependencies, and yield unreliable prediction performance. To address this issue, we propose a Transformer Hawkes Process (THP) model, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term dependencies and meanwhile enjoys computational efficiency. Numerical experiments on various datasets show that THP outperforms existing models in terms of both likelihood and event prediction accuracy by a notable margin. Moreover, THP is quite general and can incorporate additional structural knowledge. We provide a concrete example, where THP achieves improved prediction performance for learning multiple point processes when incorporating their relational information.

title:  [ICML 2020] Lifted Disjoint Paths with Application in Multiple Object Tracking
authors:  Roberto Henschel
abstract:  We present an extension to the disjoint paths problem in which additional lifted edges are introduced to provide path connectivity priors. We call the resulting optimization problem the lifted disjoint paths problem. We show that this problem is NP-hard by reduction from integer multicommodity flow and 3-SAT. To enable practical global optimization, we propose several classes of linear inequalities that produce a high-quality LP-relaxation. Additionally, we propose efficient cutting plane algorithms for separating the proposed linear inequalities. The lifted disjoint path problem is a natural model for multiple object tracking and allows an elegant mathematical formulation for long range temporal interactions. Lifted edges help to prevent id switches and to re-identify persons. Our lifted disjoint paths tracker achieves nearly optimal assignments with respect to input detections. As a consequence, it leads on all three main benchmarks of the MOT challenge, improving significantly over state-of-the-art.

title:  Privately Detecting Changes in Unknown Distributions
authors:  Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech
abstract:  The change-point detection problem seeks to identify distributional changes in streams of data. Increasingly, tools for change-point detection are applied in settings where data may be highly sensitive and formal privacy guarantees are required, such as identifying disease outbreaks based on hospital records, or IoT devices detecting activity within a home. Differential privacy has emerged as a powerful technique for enabling data analysis while preventing information leakage about individuals. Much of the prior work on change-point detection---including the only private algorithms for this problem---requires complete knowledge of the pre-change and post-change distributions. However, this assumption is not realistic for many practical applications of interest. This work develops differentially private algorithms for solving the change-point problem when the data distributions are unknown. Additionally, the data may be sampled from distributions that change smoothly over time, rather than fixed pre-change and post-change distributions. We apply our algorithms to detect changes in the linear trends of such data streams. Finally, we also provide experimental results to empirically validate the performance of our algorithms.

title:  Adapting a Kidney Exchange Algorithm to Align with Human Values (ICML PAML 2020)
authors:  Rachel Freedman
abstract:  The efficient and fair allocation of limited resources is a classical problem in economics and computer science. In kidney exchanges, a central market maker allocates living kidney donors to patients in need of an organ. Patients and donors in kidney exchanges are prioritized using ad-hoc weights decided on by committee and then fed into an allocation algorithm that determines who gets what--and who does not. In this paper, we provide an end-to-end methodology for estimating weights of individual participant profiles in a kidney exchange. We first elicit from human subjects a list of patient attributes they consider acceptable for the purpose of prioritizing patients (e.g., medical characteristics, lifestyle choices, and so on). Then, we ask subjects comparison queries between patient profiles and estimate weights in a principled way from their responses. We show how to use these weights in kidney exchange market clearing algorithms. We then evaluate the impact of the weights in simulations and find that the precise numerical values of the weights we computed matter little, other than the ordering of profiles that they imply. However, compared to not prioritizing patients at all, there is a significant effect, with certain classes of patients being (de)prioritized based on the human-elicited value judgments.

title:  Two Routes to Scalable Credit Assignment without Weight Symmetry @ Neuromatch 1.0 03/30/2020
authors:  Javier Sagastuy
abstract:  The neural plausibility of backpropagation has long been disputed, primarily for its use of non-local weight transport − the biologically dubious requirement that one neuron instantaneously measure the synaptic weights of another. Until recently, attempts to create local learning rules that avoid weight transport have typically failed in the large-scale learning scenarios where backpropagation shines, e.g. ImageNet categorization with deep convolutional networks. Here, we investigate a recently proposed local learning rule that yields competitive performance with backpropagation and find that it is highly sensitive to metaparameter choices, requiring laborious tuning that does not transfer across network architecture. Our analysis indicates the underlying mathematical reason for this instability, allowing us to identify a more robust local learning rule that better transfers without metaparameter tuning. Nonetheless, we find a performance and stability gap between this local rule and backpropagation that widens with increasing model depth. We then investigate several non-local learning rules that relax the need for instantaneous weight transport into a more biologically-plausible "weight estimation" process, showing that these rules match state-of-the-art performance on deep networks and operate effectively in the presence of noisy updates. Taken together, our results suggest two routes towards the discovery of neural implementations for credit assignment without weight symmetry: further improvement of local rules so that they perform consistently across architectures and the identification of biological implementations for non-local learning mechanisms.

title:  Learning to Simulate Complex Physics with Graph Networks, ICML 2020
authors:  Tobias Pfaff
abstract:  Here we present a general framework for learning simulation, and provide a single model implementation that yields state-of-the-art performance across a variety of challenging physical domains, involving fluids, rigid solids, and deformable materials interacting with one another. Our framework---which we term "Graph Network-based Simulators" (GNS)---represents the state of a physical system with particles, expressed as nodes in a graph, and computes dynamics via learned message-passing. Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework is the most accurate general-purpose learned physics simulator to date, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.

title:  Multi-Drone Delivery using Transit (ICRA 2020 Best Paper Finalist in Multi-Robot Systems)
authors:  kmenda
abstract:  We consider the problem of controlling a large fleet of drones to deliver packages simultaneously across broad urban areas. To conserve energy, drones hop between public transit vehicles (e.g., buses and trams). We design a comprehensive algorithmic framework that strives to minimize the maximum time to complete any delivery. We address the multifaceted complexity of the problem through a two-layer approach. First, the upper layer assigns drones to package delivery sequences with a near-optimal polynomial-time task allocation algorithm. Then, the lower layer executes the allocation by periodically routing the fleet over the transit network while employing efficient bounded-suboptimal multi-agent pathfinding techniques tailored to our setting. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on settings with up to 200 drones, 5000 packages, and transit networks with up to 8000 stops in San Francisco and Washington DC. Our results show that the framework computes solutions typically within a few seconds on commodity hardware, and that drones travel up to 360% of their flight range with public transit.

title:  [ICRA 2020 Best Paper] Preference-Based Learning for Exoskeleton Gait Optimization
authors:  AMBER-Lab
abstract:  This paper presents a personalized gait optimization framework for lower-body exoskeletons. Rather than optimizing numerical objectives such as the mechanical cost of transport, our approach directly learns from user preferences, e.g., for comfort. Building upon work in preference-based interactive learning, we present the CoSpar algorithm. CoSpar prompts the user to give pairwise preferences between trials and suggest improvements; as exoskeleton walking is a non-intuitive behavior, users can provide preferences more easily and reliably than numerical feedback. We show that CoSpar performs competitively in simulation and demonstrate a prototype implementation of CoSpar on a lower-body exoskeleton to optimize human walking trajectory features. In the experiments, CoSpar consistently found user-preferred parameters of the exoskeleton's walking gait, which suggests that it is a promising starting point for adapting and personalizing exoskeletons (or other assistive devices) to individual users.

title:  Quadrupedal locomotion on uneven terrain with sensorized feet
authors:  Robotic Systems Lab
abstract:  Sensing of the terrain shape is crucial for legged robots deployed in the real world since the knowledge of the local terrain inclination at the contact points allows for an optimized force distribution that minimizes the risk of slipping. In this letter, we present a reactive locomotion strategy for torque controllable quadruped robots based on sensorized feet. Since the present approach works without exteroceptive sensing, it is robust against degraded vision. Inertial and force/torque sensors implemented in specially designed feet with articulated passive ankle joints measure the local terrain inclination and interaction forces. The proposed controller exploits the contact null-space in order to minimize the tangential forces to prevent slippage even in case of extreme contact conditions. We experimentally tested the proposed method in laboratory experiments and validated the approach with the quadrupedal robot ANYmal.

title:  Matthieu Masselin: On making millions of different people walk again [ICRA 2020 WS - Legged Robots]
authors:  Legged Robots
abstract:  Wandercraft's goal is to provide a robotic platform that allows walk impaired people to walk again with our exoskeleton and to learn how to walk again by themselves. One of the most challenging aspects of building such a robot is the variety of people that can ride it. Patients differ in size, weight, strength, power they can provide during walk, behavior and can present a variety of pathologies. Thus, our main focus was to accommodate the uncertainty that represents the pilot of the exoskeleton, who can be considered as an uncontrolled disturbance with a mass equivalent to that of the robot. In this talk we will present the approach that led us to building such a robot, selling it to hospitals as a medical device. We will also discuss our most recent progresses as well as some of our future plans to build a personal walk exoskeleton.

title:  Gerardo Bledt and Donghyun Kim: MPC and Vision Aided Dynamic Walking [ICRA 2020 WS Legged robots]
authors:  Legged Robots
abstract:  Designing controllers for complex dynamic robots in unstructured terrains is a challenging, open-ended task. Optimization-based predictive controllers have proven to be powerful in producing highly robust, dynamic behaviors in legged systems. However, since "optimal solutions" are only as good as the underlying dynamics model, constraints, and cost function, we must design meaningful optimizations that produce the desired behaviors, while remaining computationally tractable. Regularized Predictive Control (RPC) is a novel nonlinear optimization-based predictive controller that optimizes robot states, footstep locations, and ground reaction forces over a future prediction horizon in real-time. The control model is presented as a highly simplified, rough feasibility constraint, while simple heuristics are embedded directly into the cost function through regularization to improve performance. The challenge of designing meaningful heuristics is tackled by a combination of expert design and data-driven analytics for extracting and fitting simple models to simulation results. These simple models are able to simultaneously capture the major effects on the system dynamics, while reducing the complexity of the controller. The task of control design is ultimately to find a controller that robustly achieves the desired performance, rather than to describe the system accurately. Often times, a "good enough" solution is better than an analytically complex or optimal one.

title:  Maurice Fallon: Navigation Systems with Quadruped robots [ICRA 2020 WS - Legged Robots]
authors:  Legged Robots
abstract:  Dynamic legged robots are moving out into the real world. We have reached a tipping point in which reliability and ruggedness of quadruped robots, in particular, is such that they are realistic alternative to wheeled robots. Case in point, in 2017, I co-founded (with Ioannis Havoutis) a legged robotics group with a specific focus on field demonstrations.  In this talk I will discuss the science and technology we have been developing, with a particular focus on the ANYbotics ANYmal, as well as discussing several field demos on industrial sites.

title:  MPC-Net: A First Principles Guided Policy Search (Presentation)
authors:  Robotic Systems Lab
abstract:  We present an Imitation Learning approach for the control of dynamical systems with a known model. Our policy search method is guided by solutions from MPC. Typical policy search methods of this kind minimize a distance metric between the guiding demonstrations and the learned policy. Our loss function, however, corresponds to the minimization of the control Hamiltonian, which derives from the principle of optimality. Therefore, our algorithm directly attempts to solve the optimality conditions with a parameterized class of control laws. Additionally, the proposed loss function explicitly encodes the constraints of the optimal control problem and we provide numerical evidence that its minimization achieves improved constraint satisfaction. We train a mixture-of-expert neural network architecture for controlling a quadrupedal robot and show that this policy structure is well suited for such multimodal systems. The learned policy can successfully stabilize different gaits on the real walking robot from less than 10 min of demonstration data.

title:  ICRA 2020: Visual-Inertial Mapping with Non-Linear Factor Recovery.
authors:  cvprtum
abstract:  Cameras and inertial measurement units are complementary sensors for ego-motion estimation and environment mapping. Their combination makes visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems more accurate and robust. For globally consistent mapping, however, combining visual and inertial information is not straightforward. To estimate the motion and geometry with a set of images large baselines are required. Because of that, most systems operate on keyframes that have large time intervals between each other. Inertial data on the other hand quickly degrades with the duration of the intervals and after several seconds of integration, it typically contains only little useful information.

title:  [ICRA 2020] The Soft-Landing Problem: Minimizing Foot Penetration Depth on Yielding Terrain
authors:  Northwestern Robotics
abstract:  Enabling robots to walk and run on yielding terrain is vital to endeavors ranging from disaster response to extraterrestrial exploration. While dynamic legged locomotion on rigid ground is challenging enough, yielding terrain presents additional challenges such as ground deformation which dissipates energy. In this paper, we examine the soft-landing problem: given some impact momentum, bring the robot to rest while minimizing foot penetration depth. To gain insight into properties of penetration depth-minimizing control policies, we formulate a constrained optimal control problem and obtain a bang-bang open-loop force profile. Motivated by examples from biology and recent advances in legged robotics, we also examine impedance-control solutions to the soft-landing problem. Through simulations and experiments, we find that optimal impedance reduces penetration depth nearly as much as the open-loop force profile, while remaining robust to model uncertainty. Lastly, we discuss the relevance of this work to minimum-cost-of-transport locomotion for several actuator design choices.

title:  Dynamical Systems for Adaptive Grasping, Navigation & CoManipulation with Humanoids (ICRA 2020 Talk)
authors:  Nadia Figueroa
abstract:  In this paper, we present an integrated approach that provides compliant control of an iCub humanoid robot and adaptive reaching, grasping, navigating and co-manipulating capabilities. We use state-dependent dynamical systems (DS) to (i) coordinate and drive the robots hands (in both position and orientation) to grasp an object using an intermediate virtual object, and (ii) drive the robot’s base while walking/navigating. The use of DS as motion generators allows us to adapt smoothly as the object moves and to re-plan on-line motion of the arms and body to reach the object’s new location. The desired motion generated by the DS are used in combination with a whole-body compliant control strategy that absorbs perturbations while walking and offers compliant behaviors for grasping and manipulation tasks. Further, the desired dynamics for the arm and body can be learned from demonstrations. By integrating these components, we achieve unprecedented adaptive behaviors for whole body manipulation. We showcase this in simulations and real-world experiments where iCub robots (i) walk-to-grasp objects, (ii) follow a human (or another iCub) through interaction and (iii) learn to navigate or co-manipulate an object from human guided demonstrations; whilst being robust to changing targets and perturbations.

This new design corresponds to a reconfigurable robotic system of systems consisting of multilinked micro aerial vehicles that presents the ability to cross narrow sections, morph its shape, ferry significant payloads, offer the potential of distributed sensing and processing, and enable system extendability. We present the system dynamics for any number of connected aerial vehicles, followed by the controller design involving a model predictive position control loop combined with multiple parallel angular controllers on SO}(3). Evaluation studies both in simulation and through experiments based on our ARC-Alpha prototype are depicted and involve coordinated maneuvering and shape configuration to cross narrow windows.

title:  [ICRA 2020 Best Paper Finalist in Multi-Robot System] Multi-Drone Delivery using Transit 
authors:  kmenda
abstract:  We consider the problem of controlling a large fleet of drones to deliver packages simultaneously across broad urban areas. To conserve energy, drones hop between public transit vehicles (e.g., buses and trams). We design a comprehensive algorithmic framework that strives to minimize the maximum time to complete any delivery. We address the multifaceted complexity of the problem through a two-layer approach. First, the upper layer assigns drones to package delivery sequences with a near-optimal polynomial-time task allocation algorithm. Then, the lower layer executes the allocation by periodically routing the fleet over the transit network while employing efficient bounded-suboptimal multi-agent pathfinding techniques tailored to our setting. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on settings with up to 200 drones, 5000 packages, and transit networks with up to 8000 stops in San Francisco and Washington DC. Our results show that the framework computes solutions typically within a few seconds on commodity hardware, and that drones travel up to 360% of their flight range with public transit.

title:  Learning Robust Control Policies for End-to-End Driving in Simulation  |  RA-L/ICRA 2020
authors:  Alexander Amini
abstract:  In this work, we present a data-driven simulation and training engine capable of learning end-to-end autonomous vehicle control policies using only sparse rewards. By leveraging real, human-collected trajectories through an environment, we render novel training data that allows virtual agents to drive along a continuum of new local trajectories consistent with the road appearance and semantics, each with a different view of the scene. We demonstrate the ability of policies learned within our simulator to generalize to and navigate in previously unseen real-world roads, without access to any human control labels during training. Our results validate the learned policy onboard a full-scale autonomous vehicle, including in previously un-encountered scenarios, such as new roads and novel, complex, near-crash situations. Our methods are scalable, leverage reinforcement learning, and apply broadly to situations requiring effective perception and robust operation in the physical world.

title:  From Planes to Corners (ICRA 2020 Video)
authors:  Tolga Birdal
abstract:  We propose a new method for segmentation-free joint estimation of orthogonal planes, their intersection lines, relationship graph and corners lying at the intersection of three orthogonal planes. Such unified scene exploration under orthogonality allows for multitudes of applications such as semantic plane detection or local and global scan alignment, which in turn can aid robot localization or grasping tasks. Our two-stage pipeline involves a rough yet joint estimation of orthogonal planes followed by a subsequent joint refinement of plane parameters respecting their orthogonality relations. We form a graph of these primitives, paving the way to the extraction of further reliable features: lines and corners. Our experiments demonstrate the validity of our approach in numerous scenarios from wall detection to 6D tracking, both on synthetic and real data.

title:  ICRA2020 Pitch Video: Motion Primitives-based Path Planning for Fast and Agile Exploration
authors:  Kostas Alexis
abstract:  This paper presents a novel path planning strategy for fast and agile exploration using aerial robots. Tailored to the combined need for large-scale exploration of challenging and confined environments, despite the limited endurance of micro aerial vehicles, the proposed planner employs motion primitives to identify admissible paths that search the configuration space, while exploiting the dynamic flight properties of small aerial robots. Utilizing a computationally efficient volumetric representation of the environment, the planner provides fast collision-free and future-safe paths that maximize the expected exploration gain and ensure continuous fast navigation through the unknown environment. The new method is field-verified in a set of deployments relating to subterranean exploration and specifically, in both modern and abandoned underground mines in Northern Nevada utilizing a 0.55m-wide collision-tolerant flying robot exploring with a speed of up to 2m/s} and navigating sections with width as small as 0.8m.

title:  [ICRA 2020 Best Paper in Robot Vision]: Graduated Non-Convexity for Robust Spatial Perception: From Non-Minimal Solvers to Global Outlier Rejection
authors:  MIT SPARK Lab
abstract:  Semidefinite Programming (SDP) and Sums-of-Squares (SOS) relaxations have led to certifiably optimal non-minimal solvers for several robotics and computer vision problems. However, most non-minimal solvers rely on least squares formulations, and, as a result, are brittle against outliers. While a standard approach to regain robustness against outliers is to use robust cost functions, the latter typically introduce other non-convexities, preventing the use of existing non-minimal solvers. In this letter, we enable the simultaneous use of non-minimal solvers and robust estimation by providing a general-purpose approach for robust global estimation, which can be applied to any problem where a nonminimal solver is available for the outlier-free case. To this end, we leverage the Black-Rangarajan duality between robust estimation and outlier processes (which has been traditionally applied to early vision problems), and show that graduated non-convexity (GNC) can be used in conjunction with non-minimal solvers to compute robust solutions, without requiring an initial guess. we demonstrate the resulting robust non-minimal solvers in applications, including point cloud and mesh registration, pose graph optimization, and image-based object pose estimation (also called shape alignment). Our solvers are robust to 70-80% of outliers, outperform RANSAC, are more accurate than specialized local solvers, and faster than specialized global solvers. We also propose the first certifiably optimal non-minimal solver for shape alignment using SOS relaxation.

title:  [ICRA 2020 Best Student Paper & Best Paper in Robot Manipulation] Design of a Roller-Based Dexterous Hand for Object Grasping and Within-Hand Manipulation
authors:  Shenli Yuan
abstract:  This paper describes the development of a novel non-anthropomorphic robot hand with the ability to manipulate objects by means of articulated, actively driven rollers located at the fingertips. An analysis is conducted and systems of equations for two-finger and three-finger manipulation of a sphere are formulated to demonstrate full six degree of freedom nonholonomic spatial motion capability. A prototype version of the hand was constructed and used to grasp and manipulate a variety of objects. Tests conducted with the prototype confirmed the validity of the mathematical analysis. Unlike conventional approaches to within-hand manipulation using legacy robotic hands, the continuous rotation capability of our rolling fingertips allows for unbounded rotation of a grasped object without the need for finger gaiting.

authors:  Daniel Frisch
abstract:  Multilateration systems reconstruct the location of a target that transmits electromagnetic or acoustic signals. The employed measurements for localization are the times of arrival (TOAs) of the transmitted signal, measured by a number of spatially distributed receivers at known positions. We present a novel multilateration algorithm to localize multiple targets that transmit indistinguishable signals at unknown times. That is, each receiver measures merely a set of TOAs with no association to the targets. Our method does not need any prior information. Therefore, it can provide uncorrelated, static measurements to be introduced into a separate tracker subsequently, or an initialization routine for multi target trackers.

title:  ICRA'20 Presentation LQR-Assisted Whole-Body Control of a Wheeled Bipedal Robot with Kinematic Loops
authors:  Ascento
abstract:  We present a hierarchical whole-body controller leveraging the full rigid body dynamics of the wheeled bipedal robot Ascento. We derive closed-form expressions for the dynamics of its kinematic loops in a way that readily generalizes to more complex systems. The rolling constraint is incorporated using a compact analytic solution based on rotation matrices. The non-minimum phase balancing dynamics are accounted for by including a linear-quadratic regulator as a motion task. Robustness when driving curves is increased by regulating the lean angle as a function of the zero-moment point. The proposed controller is computationally lightweight and significantly extends the rough-terrain capabilities and robustness of the system, as we demonstrate in several experiments.

title:  ICRA 2020 Virtual Presentation | Hand-Eye Calibration of Surgical Instrument for Robotic Surgery
authors:  Zhong Billy
abstract:  Conventional robot hand-eye calibration methods are impractical for localizing robotic instruments in minimally invasive surgeries under intra-corporeal workspace after preoperative set-up. In this letter, we present a new approach to autonomously calibrate a robotic instrument relative to a monocular camera without recognizing calibration objects or salient features. The algorithm leverages interactivemanipulation (IM) of the instrument for tracking its rigid-body motion behavior subject to the remote center-of-motion constraint. An adaptive controller is proposed to regulate the IM-induced instrument trajectory, using visual feedback, within a 3D plane which is observable from both the robot base and the camera. The eye-to-hand orientation and position are then computed via a dual-stage process allowing parameter estimation in low-dimensional spaces. The method does not require the exact knowledge of instrument model or large-scale data collection. Results fromsimulations and experiments on the da Vinci Research Kit are demonstrated via a laparoscopy resembled set-up using the proposed framework.

title:  An Efficient and Continuous Approach to Information-Theoretic Exploration @ ICRA 2020
authors:  MIT LEAN
abstract:  Exploration of unknown environments is embedded and essential in many robotics applications. Traditional algorithms, that decide where to explore by computing the expected information gain of an incomplete map from future sensor measurements, are limited to very powerful computational platforms. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for computing this expected information gain efficiently, as principally derived via mutual information. The key idea behind the proposed approach is a continuous occupancy map framework and the recursive structure it reveals. This structure makes it possible to compute the expected information gain of sensor measurements across an entire map much faster than computing each measurements’ expected gain independently. Specifically, for an occupancy map composed of |M| cells and a range sensor that emits |Θ| measurement beams, the algorithm (titled FCMI) computes the information gain corresponding to measurements made at each cell in O(|Θ||M|) steps. To the best of our knowledge, this complexity bound is better than all existing methods for computing information gain. In our experiments, we observe that this novel, continuous approach is two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art FSMI algorithm.

title:  [ICRA 2020 Best Paper Finalist] Form2Fit: Learning Shape Priors for Generalizable Assembly from Disassembly
authors:  Kevin Zakka
abstract:  Is it possible to learn policies for robotic assembly that can generalize to new objects? We explore this idea in the context of the kit assembly task. Since classic methods rely heavily on object pose estimation, they often struggle to generalize to new objects without 3D CAD models or task- specific training data. In this work, we propose to formulate the kit assembly task as a shape matching problem, where the goal is to learn a shape descriptor that establishes geometric correspondences between object surfaces and their target placement locations from visual input. This formulation enables the model to acquire a broader understanding of how shapes and surfaces fit together for assembly – allowing it to generalize to new objects and kits. To obtain training data for our model, we present a self-supervised data-collection pipeline that obtains ground truth object-to-placement correspondences by disassembling complete kits. Our resulting real-world system, Form2Fit, learns effective pick and place strategies for assembling objects into a variety of kits – achieving 90% average success rates under different initial conditions (e.g. varying object and kit poses), 94% success under new configurations of multiple kits, and over 86% success with completely new objects and kits. Code, videos, and supplemental material are available at https://form2fit.github.io/

title:  Differentiable Mapping Networks - ICRA 2020
authors:  karkus
abstract:  Mapping and localization, preferably from a small number of observations, are fundamental tasks in robotics. We address these tasks by combining spatial structure (differentiable mapping) and end-to-end learning in a novel neural network architecture: the Differentiable Mapping Network (DMN). The DMN constructs a spatially structured view-embedding map and uses it for subsequent visual localization with a particle filter. Since the DMN architecture is end-to-end differentiable, we can jointly learn the map representation and localization using gradient descent. We apply the DMN to sparse visual localization, where a robot needs to localize in a new environment with respect to a small number of images from known viewpoints. We evaluate the DMN using simulated environments and a challenging real-world Street View dataset. We find that the DMN learns effective map representations for visual localization. The benefit of spatial structure increases with larger environments, more viewpoints for mapping, and when training data is scarce.

title:  Minimal 3D Dubins Path with Bounded Curvature and Pitch Angle (ICRA 2020)
authors:  ComRob
abstract:  In this paper, we address the problem of finding cost-efficient three-dimensional paths that satisfy the maximum allowed curvature and the pitch angle of the vehicle. For any given initial and final configurations, the problem is decoupled into finding the horizontal and vertical parts of the path separately. Although the individual paths are modeled as two-dimensional Dubins curves using closed-form solutions, the final 3D path is constructed using the proposed local optimization to find a cost-efficient solution. Moreover, based on the decoupled approach, we provide a lower bound estimation of the optimal path that enables us to determine the quality of the found heuristic solution. The proposed solution has been evaluated using existing benchmark instances and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Based on the reported results and lower bounds, the proposed approach provides paths close to the optimal solution while the computational requirements are in hundreds of microseconds. Besides, the proposed method provides paths with fewer turns than others, which make them easier to be followed by the vehicle's controller.

title:  Balancing Actuation and Computing Energy in Motion Planning @ ICRA 2020
authors:  MIT LEAN
abstract:  We study a novel class of motion planning problems, inspired by emerging low-energy robotic vehicles, such as insect-size flyers, chip-size satellites, and high-endurance autonomous blimps, for which the energy consumed by computing hardware during planning a path can be as large as the energy consumed by actuation hardware during the execution of the same path. We propose a new algorithm, called Compute Energy Included Motion Planning (CEIMP). CEIMP operates similarly to any other anytime planning algorithm, except it stops when it estimates further computing will require more computing energy than potential savings in actuation energy. We show that CEIMP has the same asymptotic computational complexity as existing sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as PRM*. We also show that CEIMP outperforms the average baseline of using maximum computing resources in realistic computational experiments involving 10 floor plans from MIT buildings. In one representative experiment, CEIMP outperforms the average baseline 90.6% of the time when energy to compute one more second is equal to the energy to move one more meter, and 99.7% of the time when energy to compute one more second is equal to or greater than the energy to move 3 more meters.

title:  ICRA2020 Pitch Video: Agile Legged-Wheeled Reconfigurable Navigation Planner
authors:  Dimitrios Kanoulas
abstract:  Hybrid legged-wheeled robots such as the CENTAURO, are capable of varying their footprint polygon to carry out various agile motions. This property can be advantageous for wheeled-only planning in cluttered spaces, which is our focus. In this paper, we present an improved algorithm that builds upon our previously introduced preliminary footprint varying A* planner, which was based on the rectangular symmetry of the foot support polygon. In particular, we introduce a Theta* based planner with trapezium-like search, which aims to further reduce the limitations imposed upon the wheeled-only navigation of the CENTAURO robot by the low-dimensional search space, maintaining the real-time computational efficiency. The method is tested on the simulated and real full-size CENTAURO robot in cluttered environments.

title:  Titan Simulation Library Presentation (ICRA 2020)
authors:  Jacob Austin
abstract:  While most robotics simulation libraries are built for low-dimensional and intrinsically serial tasks, soft- body and multi-agent robotics have created a demand for simulation environments that can model many interact- ing bodies in parallel. Despite the increasing interest in these fields, no existing simulation library addresses the challenge of providing a unified, highly-parallelized, GPU- accelerated interface for simulating large robotic systems. Titan is a versatile CUDA-based C++ robotics simulation library that employs a novel asynchronous computing model for GPU-accelerated simulations of robotics primitives. The innovative GPU architecture design permits simultaneous optimization and control on the CPU while the GPU runs asynchronously, enabling rapid topology optimization and reinforcement learning iterations. Kinematics are solved with a massively parallel integration scheme that incorporates constraints and environmental forces. We report dramatically improved performance over CPU baselines, simulating as many as 300 million primitive updates per second, while allowing flexibility for a wide range of research applications. We present several applications of Titan to high-performance simulations of soft-body and multi-agent robots.

title:  ICRA '20: Distributed Attack-Robust Submodular Maximization for Multi-Robot Planning
authors:  RAAS Lab at the University of Maryland
abstract:  We aim to guard swarm-robotics applications against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that result in withdrawals of robots. We focus on applications requiring the selection of actions for each robot, among a set of available ones, e.g., which trajectory to follow. Such applications are central in large-scale robotic applications, e.g., multi-robot motion planning for target tracking. But the current attack- robust algorithms are centralized, and scale quadratically with the problem size (e.g., number of robots). In this paper, we propose a general-purpose distributed algorithm towards robust optimization at scale, with local communications only. We name it distributed robust maximization (DRM). DRM proposes a divide-and-conquer approach that distributively partitions the problem among K cliques of robots. The cliques optimize in parallel, independently of each other. That way, DRM also offers computational speed-ups up to 1/K2 the running time of its centralized counterparts. K depends on the robots’ communication range, which is given as input to DRM. DRM also achieves a close-to-optimal performance. We demonstrate DRM’s performance in Gazebo and MATLAB simulations, in scenarios of active target tracking with multiple robots. We observe DRM achieves significant computational speed-ups (it is 3 to 4 orders faster) and, yet, nearly matches the tracking performance of its centralized counterparts.

title:  MICCAI 2020 - Fernando Pérez-García - Simulation of resection cavity for self-supervised learning
authors:  Fernando Pérez-García
abstract:  Resective surgery may be curative for drug-resistant focal epilepsy, but only 40% to 70% of patients achieve seizure freedom after surgery. Retrospective quantitative analysis could elucidate patterns in resected structures and patient outcomes to improve resective surgery. However, the resection cavity must first be segmented on the postoperative MR image. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art image segmentation technique, but require large amounts of annotated data for training. Annotation of medical images is a time-consuming process requiring highly-trained raters, and often suffering from high inter-rater variability. Self-supervised learning can be used to generate training instances from unlabeled data. We developed an algorithm to simulate resections on preoperative MR images. We curated a new dataset, EPISURG, comprising 431 postoperative and 269 preoperative MR images from 431 patients who underwent resective surgery. In addition to EPISURG, we used three public datasets comprising 1813 preoperative MR images for training. We trained a 3D CNN on artificially resected images created on the fly during training, using images from 1) EPISURG, 2) public datasets and 3) both. To evaluate trained models, we calculate Dice score (DSC) between model segmentations and 200 manual annotations performed by three human raters. The model trained on data with manual annotations obtained a median (interquartile range) DSC of 65.3 (30.6). The DSC of our best-performing model, trained with no manual annotations, is 81.7 (14.2). For comparison, inter-rater agreement between human annotators was 84.0 (9.9). We demonstrate a training method for CNNs using simulated resection cavities that can accurately segment real resection cavities, without manual annotations.

title:  [MICCAI 2020] Deep Selection: A Fully Supervised Camera Selection Network for Surgery Recordings
authors:  Hyper Vision Research Laboratory
abstract:  Recording surgery in operating rooms is an essential task for education and evaluation of medical treatment. However, recording the desired targets, such as the surgery eld, surgical tools, or doctor's hands, is difficult because the targets are heavily occluded during surgery. We use a recording system in which multiple cameras are embedded in the surgical lamp, and we assume that at least one camera is recording the target without occlusion at any given time. As the embedded cameras obtain multiple video sequences, we address the task of selecting the camera with the best view of the surgery. Unlike the conventional method, which selects the camera based on the area size of the surgery eld, we propose a deep neural network that predicts the camera selection probability from multiple video sequences by learning the supervision of the expert annotation. We created a dataset in which six different types of plastic surgery are recorded, and we provided the annotation of camera switching. Our experiments show that our approach successfully switched between cameras and outperformed three baseline methods.

title:  [MICCAI 2020] Automatic Probe Movement Guidance for Freehand Obstetric Ultrasound
authors:  Richard Droste
abstract:  We present the first system that provides real-time probe movement guidance for acquiring standard planes in routine freehand obstetric ultrasound scanning. Such a system can contribute to the worldwide deployment of obstetric ultrasound scanning by lowering the required level of operator expertise. The system employs an artificial neural network that receives the ultrasound video signal and the motion signal of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that is attached to the probe, and predicts a guidance signal. The network termed US-GuideNet predicts either the movement towards the standard plane position (goal prediction), or the next movement that an expert sonographer would perform (action prediction). While existing models for other ultrasound applications are trained with simulations or phantoms, we train our model with real-world ultrasound video and probe motion data from 464 routine clinical scans by 17 accredited sonographers. Evaluations for 3 standard plane types show that the model provides a useful guidance signal with an accuracy of 88.8% for goal prediction and 90.9% for action prediction.

abstract:  Feature hashing and other random projection schemes are commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. The goal is to efficiently project a high-dimensional feature vector living in R^n into a much lower-dimensional space R^m, while approximately preserving Euclidean norm. These schemes can be constructed using sparse random projections, for example using a sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform. A line of work introduced by Weinberger et. al (ICML '09) analyzes the accuracy of sparse JL with sparsity 1 on feature vectors with small l_infinity-to-l_2 norm ratio. Recently, Freksen, Kamma, and Larsen (NeurIPS '18) closed this line of work by proving a tight tradeoff between l_infinity-to-l_2 norm ratio and accuracy for sparse JL with sparsity 1. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of using sparsity s greater than 1 in sparse JL on feature vectors. Our main result is a tight tradeoff between l_infinity-to-l_2 norm ratio and accuracy for a general sparsity s, that significantly generalizes the result of Freksen et. al. Our result theoretically demonstrates that sparse JL with s > 1 can have significantly better norm-preservation properties on feature vectors than sparse JL with s = 1; we also empirically demonstrate this finding.

abstract:  In an effort to better understand the different ways in which the discount factor affects the optimization process in reinforcement learning, we designed a set of experiments to study each effect in isolation. Our analysis reveals that the common perception that poor performance of low discount factors is caused by (too) small action-gaps requires revision. We propose an alternative hypothesis that identifies the size-difference of the action-gap across the state-space as the primary cause. We then introduce a new method that enables more homogeneous action-gaps by mapping value estimates to a logarithmic space. We prove convergence for this method under standard assumptions and demonstrate empirically that it indeed enables lower discount factors for approximate reinforcement-learning methods. This in turn allows tackling a class of reinforcement-learning problems that are challenging to solve with traditional methods.

title:  [NeurIPS 2019 Paper Highlight] Sharon Zhou @ Stanford: HYPE of Generative Models
authors:  Robin.ly
abstract:  Generative models often use human evaluations to measure the perceived quality of their outputs. Automated metrics are noisy indirect proxies, because they rely on heuristics or pretrained embeddings. However, up until now, direct human evaluation strategies have been ad-hoc, neither standardized nor validated. Our work establishes a gold standard human benchmark for generative realism. We construct Human eYe Perceptual Evaluation (HYPE) a human benchmark that is (1) grounded in psychophysics research in perception, (2) reliable across different sets of randomly sampled outputs from a model, (3) able to produce separable model performances, and (4) efficient in cost and time. We introduce two variants: one that measures visual perception under adaptive time constraints to determine the threshold at which a model's outputs appear real (e.g. 250ms), and the other a less expensive variant that measures human error rate on fake and real images sans time constraints. We test HYPE across six state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks and two sampling techniques on conditional and unconditional image generation using four datasets: CelebA, FFHQ, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. We find that HYPE can track model improvements across training epochs, and we confirm via bootstrap sampling that HYPE rankings are consistent and replicable.

title:  From the Lab to Production: A Case Study of Session-Based Recommendations in the Home-Improvement Domain[Full Video]
authors:  Pigi Kouki
abstract:  E-commerce applications rely heavily on session-based recommendation algorithms to improve the shopping experience of their customers. Recent progress in session-based recommendation algorithms shows great promise. However, translating that promise to real-world outcomes is a challenging task for several reasons, but mostly due to the large number and varying characteristics of the available models. In this paper, we discuss the approach and lessons learned from the process of identifying and deploying a successful session-based recommendation algorithm for a leading e-commerce application in the home-improvement domain. To this end, we initially evaluate fourteen session-based recommendation algorithms in an offline setting using eight different popular evaluation metrics on three datasets. The results indicate that offline evaluation does not provide enough insight to make an informed decision since there is no clear winning method on all metrics. Additionally, we observe that standard offline evaluation metrics fall short for this application. Specifically, they reward an algorithm only when it predicts the exact same item that the user clicked next or eventually purchased. In a practical scenario, however, there are near-identical products which, although they are assigned different identifiers, they should be considered as equally-good recommendations. To overcome these limitations, we perform an additional round of evaluation, where human experts provide both objective and subjective feedback for the recommendations of five algorithms that performed the best in the offline evaluation. We find that the experts’ opinion is oftentimes different from the offline evaluation results. Analysis of the feedback confirms that the performance of all models is significantly higher when we evaluate near-identical product recommendations as relevant. Finally, we run an A/B test with one of the models that performed the best in the human evaluation phase. The treatment model increased conversion rate by 15.6% and revenue per visit by 18.5% when compared with a leading third-party solution.

title:  VMI-PSL: Visual Model Inspector for Probabilistic Soft Logic - RecSys 2020 Teaser - Tarun Salh
authors:  LINQS Lab
abstract:  Hybrid recommender systems achieve state-of-the-art performance by integrating several different information sources along with multiple recommendation approaches. Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) has been shown to be an accessible and effective means of creating extensible hybrid recommenders (Kouki et al., 2015). PSL allows users to easily create intuitive models that incorporate background information and capture complex interactions. However these complex interactions can sometimes make PSL models difficult to inspect, debug, and understand. In this paper, we present a generic visual model inspector for PSL, and show how our inspector can be used on a hybrid recommender system to: debug errors in the model, analyze the performance of individual components of the model, and explain recommendations made by the model.

title:  [SIGGRAPH 2020] Incremental Potential Contact (IPC)
authors:  Minchen Li
abstract:  Contacts weave through every aspect of our physical world, from daily household chores to acts of nature. Modeling and predictive computation of these phenomena for solid mechanics is important to every discipline concerned with the motion of mechanical systems, including engineering and animation. Nevertheless, efficiently time-stepping accurate and consistent simulations of real-world contacting elastica remains an outstanding computational challenge. To model the complex interaction of deforming solids in contact we propose Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) – a new model and algorithm for variationally solving implicitly time-stepped nonlinear elastodynamics. IPC maintains an intersection- and inversion-free trajectory regardless of material parameters, time step sizes, impact velocities, severity of deformation, or boundary conditions enforced.

title:  Stormscapes: Simulating Cloud Dynamics in the Now (SIGGRAPH Asia 2020)
authors:  KAUST Computational Sciences
abstract:  The complex interplay of a number of physical and meteorological phenomena makes simulating clouds a challenging and open research problem. We explore a physically accurate model for simulating clouds and the dynamics of their transitions. We propose first-principle formulations for computing buoyancy and air pressure that allow us to simulate the variations of atmospheric density and varying temperature gradients. Our simulation allows us to model various cloud types, such as cumulus, stratus, and stratoscumulus, and their realistic formations caused by changes in the atmosphere. Moreover, we are able to simulate large-scale cloud super cells – clusters of cumulonimbus formations – that are commonly present during thunderstorms. To enable the efficient exploration of these stormscapes, we propose a lightweight set of high-level parameters that allow us to intuitively explore cloud formations and dynamics. Our method allows us to simulate cloud formations of up to about 20km×20km extents at interactive rates. We explore the capabilities of physically accurate and yet interactive cloud simulations by showing numerous examples and by coupling our model with atmosphere measurements of real-time weather services to simulate cloud formations in the now. Finally, we quantitatively assess our model with cloud fraction profiles, a common measure for comparing cloud types.

title:  AnisoMPM Virtual Presentation [SIGGRAPH 2020]
authors:  Joshuah Wolper
abstract:  Dynamic fracture surrounds us in our day-to-day lives, but animating this phenomenon is notoriously difficult and only further complicated by anisotropic materials---those with underlying structures that dictate preferred fracture directions. Thus, we present AnisoMPM: a robust and general approach for animating the dynamic fracture of isotropic, transversely isotropic, and orthotropic materials. AnisoMPM has three core components: a technique for anisotropic damage evolution, methods for anisotropic elastic response, and a coupling approach. For anisotropic damage, we adopt a non-local continuum damage mechanics (CDM) geometric approach to crack modeling and augment this with structural tensors to encode material anisotropy. Furthermore, we discretize our damage evolution with explicit and implicit integration, giving a high degree of computational efficiency and flexibility. We also utilize a QR-decomposition based anisotropic constitutive model that is inversion safe, more efficient than SVD models, easy to implement, robust to extreme deformations, and that captures all aforementioned modes of anisotropy. Our elasto-damage coupling is enforced through an additive decomposition of our hyperelasticity into a tensile and compressive component in which damage is used to degrade the tensile contribution to allow for material separation. For extremely stiff fibered materials, we further introduce a novel Galerkin weak form discretization that enables embedded directional inextensibility. We present this as a hard-constrained grid velocity solve that poses an alternative to our anisotropic elasticity that is locking-free and can model very stiff materials.

title:  [SIGGRAPH 2020] Real-Time Ray-Traced Ambient Occlusion of Complex Scenes usingSpatial Hashing
authors:  pascal gautron
abstract:  Ambient occlusion is often approximated in real-time using screen-space techniques, leading to visible artifacts. Raytracing provides a unique way to increase the rendering fidelity by accurately sampling the distance to the surrounding objects, but it introduces sampling noise. We propose a real-time ray-traced ambient occlusion technique in which noise is filtered in world space. Using extended spatial hashing for efficient storage, multiresolution AO evaluation and ad-hoc filtering, we demonstrate the usability of our technique as a production feature usable in CAD viewports with scenes comprising hundreds of millions of polygons.

title:  Homogenized Yarn-Level Cloth (SIGGRAPH 2020)
authors:  Visual Computing@IST Austria
abstract:  We present a method for animating yarn-level cloth effects using a thin-shell solver. We accomplish this through numerical homogenization: we first use a large number of yarn-level simulations to build a model of the potential energy density of the cloth, and then use this energy density function to compute forces in a thin shell simulator. We model several yarn-based materials, including both woven and knitted fabrics. Our model faithfully reproduces expected effects like the stiffness of woven fabrics, and the highly deformable nature and anisotropy of knitted fabrics.

We extend linear water wave theory to work in non-planar domains which deform over time, and we discretize the theory using Lagrangian wave packets attached to spline curves. The method is numerically stable and trivially parallelizable, and it produces high frequency ripples with dispersive wave-like behaviors customized to the underlying fluid simulation.

title:  SIGGRAPH 2020 Technical Paper: n-Dimensional Rigid Body Dynamics
authors:  Miegakure
abstract:  I present a formulation for Rigid Body Dynamics that is independent of the dimension of the space. I describe the state and equations of motion of rigid bodies using geometric algebra. Using collision detection algorithms extended to nD I resolve collisions and contact between bodies. My implementation is 4D, but the techniques described here apply to any number of dimensions. I display these four-dimensional rigid bodies by taking a three-dimensional slice through them. I allow the user to manipulate these bodies in real-time.

title:  One Shot 3D Photography (SIGGRAPH 2020)
authors:  Johannes Kopf
abstract:  3D photography is a new medium that allows viewers to more fully experience a captured moment. In this work, we refer to a 3D photo as one that displays parallax induced by moving the viewpoint (as opposed to a stereo pair with a fixed viewpoint). 3D photos are static in time, like traditional photos, but are displayed with interactive parallax on mobile or desktop screens, as well as on Virtual Reality devices, where viewing it also includes stereo. We present an end-to-end system for creating and viewing 3D photos, and the algorithmic and design choices therein. Our 3D photos are captured in a single shot and processed directly on a mobile device. The method starts by estimating depth from the 2D input image using a new monocular depth estimation network that is optimized for mobile devices. It performs competitively to the state-of-the-art, but has lower latency and peak memory consumption and uses an order of magnitude fewer parameters. The resulting depth is lifted to a layered depth image, and new geometry is synthesized in parallax regions. We synthesize color texture and structures in the parallax regions as well, using an inpainting network, also optimized for mobile devices, on the LDI directly. Finally, we convert the result into a mesh-based representation that can be efficiently transmitted and rendered even on low-end devices and over poor network connections. Altogether, the processing takes just a few seconds on a mobile device, and the result can be instantly viewed and shared. We perform extensive quantitative evaluation to validate our system and compare its new components against the current state-of-the-art.

authors:  Sebastian Starke
abstract:  Controlling characters to perform a large variety of dynamic, fast-paced and quickly changing movements is a key challenge in character animation. In this research, we present a deep learning framework to interactively synthesize such animations in high quality, both from unstructured motion data and without any manual labeling. We introduce the concept of local motion phases, and show our system being able to produce various motion skills, such as ball dribbling and professional maneuvers in basketball plays, shooting, catching, avoidance, multiple locomotion modes as well as different character and object interactions, all generated under a unified framework.

title:  [SIGGRAPH 2020] AnisoMPM: Animating Anisotropic Damage Mechanics
authors:  Joshuah Wolper
abstract:  Dynamic fracture surrounds us in our day-to-day lives, but animating this phenomenon is notoriously difficult and only further complicated by anisotropic materials---those with underlying structures that dictate preferred fracture directions. Thus, we present AnisoMPM: a robust and general approach for animating the dynamic fracture of isotropic, transversely isotropic, and orthotropic materials. AnisoMPM has three core components: a technique for anisotropic damage evolution, methods for anisotropic elastic response, and a coupling approach. For anisotropic damage, we adopt a non-local continuum damage mechanics (CDM) geometric approach to crack modeling and augment this with structural tensors to encode material anisotropy. Furthermore, we discretize our damage evolution with explicit and implicit integration, giving a high degree of computational efficiency and flexibility. We also utilize a QR-decomposition based anisotropic constitutive model that is inversion safe, more efficient than SVD models, easy to implement, robust to extreme deformations, and that captures all aforementioned modes of anisotropy. Our elasto-damage coupling is enforced through an additive decomposition of our hyperelasticity into a tensile and compressive component in which damage is used to degrade the tensile contribution to allow for material separation. For extremely stiff fibered materials, we further introduce a novel Galerkin weak form discretization that enables embedded directional inextensibility. We present this as a hard-constrained grid velocity solve that poses an alternative to our anisotropic elasticity that is locking-free and can model very stiff materials.

title:  A Class of C2 Interpolating Splines - Paper Presentation at SIGGRAPH 2020
authors:  Cem Yuksel
abstract:  We present a class of non-polynomial parametric splines that interpolate the given control points and show that some curve types in this class have a set of highly desirable properties that were not previously demonstrated for interpolating curves before. In particular, the formulation of this class guarantees that the resulting curves have C2 continuity everywhere and local support, such that only four control points define each curve segment between consecutive control points. These properties are achieved directly due to the mathematical formulation used for defining this class, without the need for a global numerical optimization step. We also provide four example spline types within this class. These examples show how guaranteed self-intersection-free curve segments can be achieved, regardless of the placement of control points, which has been a limitation of prior interpolating curve formulations. In addition, they present how perfect circular arcs and linear segments can be formed by splines within this class, which also have been challenging for prior methods of interpolating curves.

title:  [SIGGRAPH 2020] RoboCut: Hot-wire Cutting with Robot-controlled Flexible Rods
authors:  Simon Duenser
abstract:  Hot-wire cutting is a subtractive fabrication technique used to carve foam and similar materials. Conventional machines rely on straight wires and are thus limited to creating piecewise ruled surfaces. In this work, we propose a method that exploits a dual-arm robot setup to actively control the shape of a flexible, heated rod as it cuts through the material. While this setting offers great freedom of shape, using it effectively requires concurrent reasoning about three tightly coupled sub-problems: 1) modeling the way in which the shape of the rod and the surface it sweeps are governed by the robot’s motions; 2) approximating a target shape through a sequence of surfaces swept by the equilibrium shape of an elastic rod; and 3) generating collisionfree motion trajectories that lead the robot to create desired sweeps with the deformable tool. We present a computational framework for robotic hot wire cutting that addresses all three sub-problems in a unified manner. We evaluate our approach on a set of simulated results and physical artefacts generated with our robotic fabrication system.

title:  (SIGGRAPH 2020) Chemomechanical Simulation of Soap Film Flow on Spherical Bubbles
authors:  Chenfanfu Jiang
abstract:  Soap bubbles are widely appreciated for their fragile nature and their colorful appearance. The natural sciences and, in extension, computer graphics, have comprehensively studied the mechanical behavior of films and foams, as well as the optical properties of thin liquid layers. In this paper, we focus on the dynamics of material flow within the soap film, which results in fascinating, extremely detailed patterns. This flow is characterized by a complex coupling between surfactant concentration and Marangoni surface tension. We propose a novel chemomechanical simulation framework rooted in lubrication theory, which makes use of a custom semi-Lagrangian advection solver to enable the simulation of soap film dynamics on spherical bubbles both in free flow as well as under body forces such as gravity or external air flow. By comparing our simulated outcomes to videos of real-world soap bubbles recorded in a studio environment, we show that our framework, for the first time, closely recreates a wide range of dynamic effects that are also observed in experiment.

title:  Clip-art Vectorization paper (SIGGRAPH 2020)
authors:  UBC_CS
abstract:  Raster clip-art images, which consist of distinctly colored regions separated by sharp boundaries typically allow for a clear mental vector interpretation. Vectorizing these images can facilitate compact lossless storage and enable numerous processing operations. Despite recent progress, existing vectorization methods that target this data frequently produce vectorizations that fail to meet viewer expectations. We present PolyFit, a new clip-art vectorization method that produces outputs well aligned with human preferences. Since segmentation of such inputs into regions had been addressed successfully, we focus on fitting piecewise smooth vector curves to the raster input region boundaries, a task prior methods are particularly prone to fail on. While perceptual studies suggest the criteria humans are likely to use during mental boundary vectorization, they provide no guidance as to the exact interaction between them; learning these interactions directly is problematic due to the large size of the solution space. To obtain the desired solution, we first approximate the raster region boundaries with coarse intermediate polygons leveraging a combination of perceptual cues with observations from studies of human preferences. We then use these intermediate polygons as auxiliary inputs for computing piecewise smooth vectorizations. We define a finite set of potential polygon to curve primitive maps, and learn the mapping from the polygons to their best fitting primitive configurations from human annotations, arriving at a compact set of local raster and polygon properties whose combinations reliably predict human-expected primitive choices. We obtain the final vectorization by fitting the computed primitive sequence to the raster data. Comparative user studies show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on a wide range of data; our results are preferred three times as often as those of the closest competitor across inputs with various resolutions. On low-resolution color data, this preference grows to a ratio of more than 15:1.

title:  Neural Subdivision (SIGGRAPH 2020)
authors:  Hsueh-Ti Derek Liu
abstract:  This paper introduces Neural Subdivision, a novel framework for data-driven coarse-to-fine geometry modeling. During inference, our method takes a coarse triangle mesh as input and recursively subdivides it to a finer geometry by applying the fixed topological updates of Loop Subdivision, but predicting vertex positions using a neural network conditioned on the local geometry of a patch. This approach enables us to learn complex non-linear subdivision schemes, beyond simple linear averaging used in classical techniques. One of our key contributions is a novel self-supervised training setup that only requires a set of high-resolution meshes for learning network weights. For any training shape, we stochastically generate diverse low-resolution discretizations of coarse counterparts, while maintaining a bijective mapping that prescribes the exact target position of every new vertex during the subdivision process. This leads to a very efficient and accurate loss function for conditional mesh generation, and enables us to train a method that generalizes across discretizations and favors preserving the manifold structure of the output. During training we optimize for the same set of network weights across all local mesh patches, thus providing an architecture that is not constrained to a specific input mesh, fixed genus, or category. Our network encodes patch geometry in a local frame in a rotation- and translation-invariant manner. Jointly, these design choices enable our method to generalize well, and we demonstrate that even when trained on a single high-resolution mesh our method generates reasonable subdivisions for novel shapes.

title:  XNect: Real-time Multi-person 3D Motion Capture With a Single RGB Camera (SIGGRAPH 2020)
authors:  Christian Theobalt
abstract:  We present a real-time approach for multi-person 3D motion capture at over 30 fps using a single RGB camera. It operates successfully in generic scenes which may contain occlusions by objects and by other people. Our method operates in subsequent stages. The first stage is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that estimates 2D and 3D pose features along with identity assignments for all visible joints of all individuals. We contribute a new architecture for this CNN, called SelecSLS Net, that uses novel selective long and short range skip connections to improve the information flow allowing for a drastically faster network without compromising accuracy. In the second stage, a fully-connected neural network turns the possibly partial (on account of occlusion) 2D pose and 3D pose features for each subject into a complete 3D pose estimate per individual. The third stage applies space-time skeletal model fitting to the predicted 2D and 3D pose per subject to further reconcile the 2D and 3D pose, and enforce temporal coherence. Our method returns the full skeletal pose in joint angles for each subject. This is a further key distinction from previous work that do not produce joint angle results of a coherent skeleton in real time for multi-person scenes. The proposed system runs on consumer hardware at a previously unseen speed of more than 30 fps given 512x320 images as input while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, which we will demonstrate on a range of challenging real-world scenes.

title:  [SIGGRAPH 2020] CARL: Controllable Agent with Reinforcement Learning for Quadruped Locomotion
authors:  AI Center Inventec
abstract:  Motion synthesis in a dynamic environment has been a long-standing problem for character animation. Methods using motion capture data tend to scale poorly in complex environments because of their larger capturing and labeling requirement. Physics-based controllers are effective in this regard, albeit less controllable. In this paper, we present CARL, a quadruped agent that can be controlled with high-level directives and react naturally to dynamic environments. Starting with an agent that can imitate individual animation clips, we use Generative Adversarial Networks to adapt high-level controls, such as speed and heading, to action distributions that correspond to the original animations. Further fine-tuning through the deep reinforcement learning enables the agent to recover from unseen external perturbations while producing smooth transitions. It then becomes straightforward to create autonomous agents in dynamic environments by adding navigation modules over the entire process. We evaluate our approach by measuring the agent's ability to follow user control and provide a visual analysis of the generated motion to show its effectiveness.

Usually such judgments are made by experts, like journalists for political statements or medical doctors for medical statements. In this paper, we follow a different approach and rely on (non-expert) crowd workers. This of course leads to the following research question: Can crowdsourcing be reliably used to assess the truthfulness of information and to create large-scale labeled collections for information credibility systems? To address this issue, we present the results of an extensive study based on crowdsourcing: we collect thousands of truthfulness assessments over two datasets, and we compare expert judgments with crowd judgments, expressed on scales with various granularity levels. We also measure the political bias and the cognitive background of the workers, and quantify their effect on the reliability of the data provided by the crowd.

title:  SIGIR 2020 Presentation - Policy-Aware Unbiased Learning to Rank for Top-k Rankings
authors:  Harrie Oosterhuis
abstract:  Counterfactual Learning to Rank (LTR) methods optimize ranking systems using logged user interactions that contain interaction biases. Existing methods are only unbiased if users are presented with all relevant items in every ranking. There is currently no existing counterfactual unbiased LTR method for top-k rankings. We introduce a novel policy-aware counterfactual estimator for LTR metrics that can account for the effect of a stochastic logging policy. We prove that the policy-aware estimator is unbiased if every relevant item has a non-zero probability to appear in the top-k ranking. Our experimental results show that the performance of our estimator is not affected by the size of k: for any k, the policy-aware estimator reaches the same retrieval performance while learning from top-k feedback as when learning from feedback on the full ranking. Lastly, we introduce novel extensions of traditional LTR methods to perform counterfactual LTR and to optimize top-k metrics. Together, our contributions introduce the first policy-aware unbiased LTR approach that learns from top-k feedback and optimizes top-k metrics. As a result, counterfactual LTR is now applicable to the very prevalent top-k ranking setting in search and recommendation.

title:  Retrieving Potential Causes from a Query Event: SIGIR 2020 Pre-recorded Presentation
authors:  Debasis Ganguly
abstract:  Different to traditional IR, which retrieves a set of topically relevant
documents given a user query, we investigate causal retrieval, which
involves retrieving a set of documents that describe a set of potential
causes leading to an effect specified in the query. We argue that the
nature of causal relevance should be different to that of traditional
topical relevance. This is because although the causally relevant
documents would have partial term overlap with the ones that are
topically relevant for a query, yet it is expected that a majority
of these documents would use a different set of terms to describe
a number of causes possibly leading to their effects. To address
this, we propose a feedback model to estimate a distribution of
terms which are relatively infrequent but associated with high
weights in the topically relevant distribution, leading to potential
causal relevance. Our experiments demonstrate that such a feedback
model turns out to be substantially more effective than traditional
IR models and a number of other causality heuristic baselines.

title:  Amazon Science: A robust and efficient framework for sports field registration [WACV 2020]
authors:  CrossMinds Editorial Team
abstract:  We propose a novel framework to register sports-fields as they appear in broadcast sports videos. Unlike previous approaches, we particularly address the challenge of field registration when: (a) there are not enough distinguishable features on the field, and (b) no prior knowledge is available about the camera. To this end, we detect a grid of keypoints distributed uniformly on the entire field instead of using only sparse local corners and line intersections, thereby extending the keypoint coverage to the texture-less parts of the field as well. To further improve keypoint based homography estimate, we differentialbly warp and align it with a set of dense field-features defined as normalized distancemap of pixels to their nearest lines and key-regions. We predict the keypoints and dense field-features simultaneously using a multi-task deep network to achieve computational efficiency. To have a comprehensive evaluation, we have compiled a new dataset called SportsFields which is collected from 192 video-clips from 5 different sports covering large environmental and camera variations. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm not only achieves state of the art field-registration accuracy but also runs in real-time for HD resolution videos using commodity hardware.

title:  WACV 2021 - Efficient Attention: Attention with Linear Complexities
authors:  Shen Zhuoran
abstract:  We proposed a novel attention mechanism with linear memory and computational complexities and the same representational power as the quadratically-complex dot-product attention. We demonstrated that our method scales to high-resolution images, video inputs, and other types of visual data with results on 3 datasets and 4 tasks.
